It's funny and often charming, but it's a very uneven movie, mostly due to the episodic format, but also because I think it's very self-indulgent. Wes Anderson fanatics will eat it up, everyone else will like only some of it.

My favorite segments are the painter and the chef stories. I really don't care for the student protestors, but that's true to my character because I hate French youth and I hate leftist protests. I also found it hard to follow story-wise.

The final segment actually ties it all together in a beautiful way. The newspaper editor had brought these lonely and weird writers together into a meaningful organization, and seeing them collaborate on the obituary is heartwarming.

Wes Anderson movies have excellent music, that might be his best directorial decision other than camera framing. I am also a sucker for the way he does shootouts. So the shootout near the end, paired with that beautiful piano music, is the highlight of the whole movie for me.

This has the most stacked cast of any movie I've seen in a while.

6/10
