# Hakyll Movie Blog

[Link to the hosted site!](https://johnpaulwelsh.github.io/hakyll-movie-blog/)

This is the repository for my movie review blog, where I will write short thoughts and reviews about the movies I watch in the approximate order I watch them.

This blog is written in Hakyll. I am a novice Haskell developer so this is also an excuse for me to re-learn how to program using a language I've always admired from afar.

Thanks for visiting!
