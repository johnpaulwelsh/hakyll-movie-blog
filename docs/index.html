            <h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to my movie blog, written using Hakyll!</p>

<p>Link to my Letterboxd profile is <a href="https://letterboxd.com/sketchygalore/">here.</a></p>

<h3>What is the purpose of this website?</h3>

Whenever I watch a movie I try to write down my thoughts and reactions here. They're not really reviews because I'm not trying to persuade the reader to watch it. In fact almost every post features full spoilers. But I like the idea of letting these thoughts out there in the wild, instead of just a personal set of notes meant only for me.

<h3>Why don't you just enter reviews into your Letterboxd check-ins?</h3>

I have no interest in using Letterboxd as an actual social network, so sharing my thoughts about movies on that platform is not a priority. I use Letterboxd to keep track of what I've watched, how, and when, and star ratings. But when I need to brain-dump my thoughts about a movie or discuss the viewing experience in more detail, I write it here.
