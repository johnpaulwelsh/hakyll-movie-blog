        <p>I first watched this as a sophomore in high school, where we read and the book and watched the movie as part of my Academic Writing class. I’m really glad I had the opportunity to see it again without the memory of the book so fresh in my mind, because I think I appreciated it as a filmic work on its own a lot more this time.</p>
<p>The biggest strength of the film is the acting. The especially annoying patients ended up winning me over just as much as some of the more obvious “favorites” by the time the fishing trip scene happens. It’s refreshing to watch a movie where the characters bring a smile to your face so much of the time, something that is becoming rarer as more and more movies either add comedic elements to just about every character, or retreat into deeply dramatic portrayals with no humor at all.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of this viewing was my realization that Nurse Ratched is actually not as evil as I remember her being. She’s often put up as this perfect example of a horrible villain, but this time around I don’t think it ever really goes that far. She humiliates the patients during the group sessions, but it doesn’t seem like she’s rubbing their faces into it so much as she’s just aware of her power and convinced she is helping them. If anything, she’s scary because of how infrequently she loses her cool, not because she is an overbearing menace. A lot of McMurphy’s conflicts with her involve her being a total stickler about the rules, but I think it’s an overraction to call her a monster.</p>
<p>One thing that I was more impressed by this time is how well the film transitions from McMurphy being the main point of view to Chief becoming his own perspective. Since the whole book is told from Chief’s point of view I kinda watched the movie from that angle as well the first time through. But taken as its own story, the film does a brilliant job of sneaking in a new protagonist in the second half. Ironically it lets the audience care about McMurphy in a different way than if he was merely the hero/protagonist.</p>
