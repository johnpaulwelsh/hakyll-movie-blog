        <p>It’s good! The book is better of course, but that’s to be expected. The only thing missing really is Lewis’s internal monologue / narration where you get more into his head about why he decides to do what he did.</p>
<p>As for differences where the movie added somethig… the ending is a freakshow but it’s a pretty entertaining one. Especially when the house looks moldy and subterranean for a minute through Lewis’s eyes. At first I was repulsed by the way they did the Zelda subplot because it felt too freakshow, but the way it crops up later is pretty nice honestly.</p>
<p>The Victor ghost scenes are crucial to the tone of the movie, his comic relief is amazingly timed in the second half. Though his final appearance seems a little anticlimactic, he just yells and then goes away.</p>
<p>It’s hard to strike the right tone with a movie that literally involves a cat and then a toddler dying, because you’d think it would be so mean-spirited and nasty just due to that. But somehow they make it haunting when it needs to be, and then scary and normal zombie mobie when it needs to be, without making the emotional agony too bad for the viewer. Though my heart was breaking any time the daughter was upset, it really hit me in the father feels.</p>
<p>The early scenes before Church dies are amazing amazing, like perfect tone and pacing.</p>
<p>The outburst scene at the funeral is like a perfect 1980s Stephen King scene, it’s emotional and hacky and has that feeling that you can only get with King’s work.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
