        <p>Liked more than disliked, but it was really just okay. The storyline is too similar to <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> for me not to notice (spazzy sidekick girl is being ostracized by the de facto leader of the realm). But it’s even more hyper and silly than that, in fact it’s almost got a DreamWorks feel to it (the smirks, the physical comedy, the voice acting for Nimona). Now that I think of it, it’s also like <em>Smallfoot</em>, since the power structure is paranoid about outsiders but that’s intentionally based on a misreading of an ancient event.</p>
<p>The music choice is very lazy and hip and oriented toward young people, like come on, I don’t need riot-grrrl punk to know that the characters are being mischievous.</p>
<p>I have to admit it’s cute most of the time, funny some of the time, and well animated. I really like the monster design at the end.</p>
<p>It’s very clear that the movie was made in an era where “tolerance” is considered the ultimate good.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m necessarily opposed to the messaging in this movie, but I am annoyed at the Tumblr-ish comments on Letterboxd emphasizing the trans-coding of Nimona or the gay stuff. Like, yes it’s there, but I don’t think the movie is all that great outside of those elements. So do those reviewers elevate their opinion of the movie because it’s got trans and gay under/overtones? If so, that’s using entertainment as a way to score points and I usually don’t like that.</p>
