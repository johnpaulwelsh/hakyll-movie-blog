        <p>I don’t get it. Maybe it’s because I was intrigued by the crucifix-on-the-moon imagery and wasn’t aware of the actual plot description, so I expected it to be more wacky and conspiratorial. It seems that in the end it’s a pretty straightforward drama story, but there is so much time dedicated to hanging out with the crazy inmates that I question the focus and purpose of the film. It feels like an attempt to make a more tragic <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest</em>, but by way of spending even more time with the inmates and spending less time with the sane people in the story.</p>
<p>I did like some of it. The early scenes with the loonies are pretty entertaining, especially the guy who wants to cast dogs in Shakespeare plays. The scene in the bar goes on long enough where it became really immersive, and seeing the gang leader get riled up is actually pretty scary. And the progression of Cutshaw going from full-on crazy to sane and scared is interesting to watch, and the transition is subtle. Their discussion about whether there are any real examples of selfless sacrifice is interesting and pretty profound, I wish more of the movie were like that.</p>
