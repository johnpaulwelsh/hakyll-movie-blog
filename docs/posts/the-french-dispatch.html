        <p>It’s funny and often charming, but it’s a very uneven movie, mostly due to the episodic format, but also because I think it’s very self-indulgent. Wes Anderson fanatics will eat it up, everyone else will like only some of it.</p>
<p>My favorite segments are the painter and the chef stories. I really don’t care for the student protestors, but that’s true to my character because I hate French youth and I hate leftist protests. I also found it hard to follow story-wise.</p>
<p>The final segment actually ties it all together in a beautiful way. The newspaper editor had brought these lonely and weird writers together into a meaningful organization, and seeing them collaborate on the obituary is heartwarming.</p>
<p>Wes Anderson movies have excellent music, that might be his best directorial decision other than camera framing. I am also a sucker for the way he does shootouts. So the shootout near the end, paired with that beautiful piano music, is the highlight of the whole movie for me.</p>
<p>This has the most stacked cast of any movie I’ve seen in a while.</p>
