        <p>Peter Jackson is a madman and everyone he hired for this movie is totally insane.</p>
<p>I really love how most of the cast doesn’t seem like the kind of people who’d be interested in making a movie like this, let alone go into it 110%. Especially the girl who plays Paquita and the guy who plays the priest, they especially seem too normal and/or nice to be hanging out with the deranged lunatics who masterminded this movie.</p>
<p>I was worried that the movie would be too gross or disturbing based on what I had heard, and I also worried that there’d be a mean streak like there is in <em>Meet the Feebles</em>. I am happy to report I was wrong on both counts. The gross-out humor is separated out pretty well, and doesn’t involve much vomit or other non-blood fluids. The scenes where Lionel is trying to take care of the “deadites” in a domestic setting are honestly some of the funniest scenes. I was roaring when he takes the baby to the park.</p>
<p>I actually like how bone-headedly obvious the “rebirth” imagery is at the end. It gives the movie a slightly higher intellect than it would otherwise have. But of course the movie isn’t meaningful, it’s just an opportunity to make a corny old 1950s horror movie with slapstick humor and an unbelievable amount of blood and gore. In that sense it also contrasts with <em>Meet the Feebles</em>, in that it knows exactly what it’s trying to go for, and executes on it perfectly.</p>
<p>I almost feel bad thinking about this movie and <em>Evil Dead II</em> at the same time, because I’m tempted to decide which one is my favorite. It’s like choosing between my children.</p>
