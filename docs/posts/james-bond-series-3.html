        <p><strong>15) <em>A View to a Kill</em> (03.03.23)</strong></p>
<p>Boring in theory, but good enough in practice. By the end of the movie I thought back to the horse stuff at the beginning and thought, “if the whole movie was like that then it would be really dull.” So I guess that means the script is pretty good at ramping up the stakes. The showdown in the caves and the bridge are both in the upper half of best Bond setpieces so far in the series.</p>
<p>Christopher Walken is kind of a great Bond villain, but part of the joy is to see Walken be Walken as opposed to really being a “character.” If he’s meant to be French then I’m a monkey’s uncle.</p>
<p>The girls in this movie are more involved as actual characters compared to the usual Bond Girls, and luckily Stacey is not a total idiot like can sometimes happen with the nice-girl blonde in these movies.</p>
