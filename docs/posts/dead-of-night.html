        <p>One of the few anthology movies where the frame story is equally interesting as the individual stories.</p>
<p>The camera usage in the first story was really good, I was bracing myself for a jump scare the whole time.</p>
<p>The story with the little kid in the mansion might be my favorite out of the bunch.</p>
<p>I liked the mirror one but I think it lasted a little too long compared to the others. The music is pretty over-the-top in this segment.</p>
<p>The golf one is hilarious and provides a much needed breather in the overall story.</p>
<p>The ventriloquist story feels more sophisticated than other versions of this same story, if only because his dialogue is less cartoonishly evil and more just abusive.</p>
<p>The ending is pretty well done, given that it’s not the most original thing in the world. I especially liked the way the opening scenes play again under the credits, but with crazy music playing instead of the original sound track. And I will admit, the “room for one more” guy was pretty creepy.</p>
<p>I think in order for Scorsese to think this is one of the scariest movies ever, he would have to have seen it as a nine- or 10-year-old and had his mind blown by the premise of the frame story. I wasn’t nearly as impressed as he is, but I think it’s a pretty solid little horror movie from the 40s.</p>
