<p><em>The Best of Youth</em> feels like a novel set to film. There’s a level of detail and paying attention to the characters that I didn’t think is possible outside of novels.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect so much music to be integral to the story, but it really makes things memorable.</p>
<p>I also didn’t expect it to be so fast-paced, or at least so non-slow-motion. Events occur briskly when they can afford to be brisk. There really does seem to be six hours’ worth of story to tell, instead of three hours’ worth that is spread out to six.</p>
<p>All of it comes down to the encounter with Giorgia. Nicola was right when he described that summer as one “where our lives were changed, lots of people’s lives were.” Before Giorgia is taken away, Matteo is the impulsive and emotional one, though he’s a genius. And Nicola is studying to be a doctor, he’s the sensible and analytical one who is willing to work hard for his sense in life.</p>
<p>After Giorgia, they both give up their ways in life and trend toward the opposite path, but not to quite the same degree. Matteo becomes a soldier and then a police photographer, keeping to himself and keeping up his reading of literature and poetry, but also sticking to the blue-collar work that seemed to unfitted for him. He doesn’t keep in touch with his friends and family as much as he’d like to, and it hurts him inside. And Nicola becomes a roaming hippy dude worker, then a student revolutionary, but eventually makes efforts to settle down with his woman partner. He eventually finds his way back into being a doctor, in fact by running his own hospital and coming back into contact with Giorgia.</p>
<p>Nicola’s life isn’t perfect, but I wonder if the film’s central conflict will be that Matteo is more dissatisfied with his life than his brother is, and they will come to a head over that.</p>

<p>Well that’s not how I expected Matteo to end up.</p>
<p>This movie has done something that nothing else has done to me before - it’s drawn me in as if the story were real life, and I didn’t care whether it ever ended or how long it took to get to the end. I could have watched another six hours of this movie because it never felt like it was going anywhere but forward. At no point did I ever think “but what’s gonna happen next, and when will it finally move on?”</p>
<p>I think I watched this movie at exactly the right time in my life, just before I became a father. It made me realize that family is important, even more important than I previously realized. I found myself tearing up at the grandparent-level more so than the parent or child level, which I guess shows that my perspective is broadening and getting less stuck in my own time and place.</p>
<p>What else could I give this movie but a perfect score? I stopped thinking about the plot and characters in terms of “did I like it?” or “were there parts I didn’t feel right about?” The film just exists, like a true document of a life, of lives, of an entire family, and even of a nation.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>This is movie number 1,000 on my lifetime watch list. I am so glad I waited to watch this one at a special number, and I’m glad I watched it at the time in my life that I did.</p>
<p>Thank you Andrew Smith, and your sister, for leading me toward watching this marvelous film.</p>
<p>10/10</p>
