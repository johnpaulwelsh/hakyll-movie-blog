        <p>I’m very conflicted on this one. It’s one of my wife’s favorite movies but it left me cold for almost the entire runtime. It’s obviously sincere and meaningful for somebody, but I don’t think it’s for me.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but get frustrated by the flashback structure (I dislike tragic back stories, I find it to be a lazy form of storytelling). I also think it relies too much on the sentiment of, “Look at how cruel and alien the Chinese culture is. These women realized they needed to get out, but when they came to America their hopes haven’t come to fruition, for their daughters, at least not yet”. I only ever seem to watch movies about the ones who got out, but now I want to know what the generations before those rogue personalities looked like. How does such a nasty and punishing culture sustain itself? What was so-and-sos great great grandmother like, such that her great grandmother was so cruel? I wanted to see a young woman pass along these lessons to her daughter without the daughter breaking the chain. I know that’s not a good movie, but it would at least be different. <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>, <em>Encanto</em>, it’s all the same. I think I’m just sick of generational trauma as a storyline. Combine that with my alienation regarding China (I’m just not interested), and I just couldn’t care that much about this story.</p>
<p>The very end is the only part that resonated with me, where the only honorable Asian man gets to talk about his wife in a loving way. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that the only time I felt emotions about these stories was when I heard it through a diegetic voiceover, rather than a non-diegetic one.</p>
