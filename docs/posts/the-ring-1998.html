        <p>I don’t think there’s anything deep about this movie, it’s just a solid horror thriller. I think there’s a tendency to sometimes think that just because Americans remade a movie into a popular hit, that the original from a foreign country has to be more thematically legitimate or rich, or has a better story that works on multiple levels. I haven’t yet seen the American remake, but I think this is a case where that’s not what happened.</p>
<p>The climax where she finds Sadoko’s body is pretty great, I’m glad they tried to make it tender and moving instead of a scare moment, it made me feel that the story had some real emotional backing to it other than “look at how worried they are that they will die soon.”</p>
<p>The videotape itself is really creepy! Even when you’ve seen the Pointing Man or Combing Woman five times, it’s still unsettling to watch. Let alone the well.</p>
<p>There are definitely some plot points that seem really convenient. Especially the fact that the man knew all of the story details about the doctor and the psychic, or that he was a psychic himself. I don’t think it ruined the movie for me, but I think it’s objectively lazy plot development. Again, I’d like to see the American remake to see if they clean that up, or if it’s just as out-of-left-field as in this movie.</p>
<p>When Ruiju sees the feet of the person standing in front of him and asked “are you the one who’s doing this?” I wonder what that means. It led me to believe that he would have some secret involvement in the plot beyond just helping the woman, but I guess not.</p>
<p>The music was good, definitely went for creepy or dramatic in very obvious ways but still effective.</p>
<p>The ending twist is the kind of cheap contrivance that I’d expect from a lazy PG-13 horror movie from America, but given that this movie came out in 1998 I wonder if it contributed to making that a trope, instead of being one offender in a long line. But I must admit, seeing Sadoko come out of the TV was worth the wait.</p>
