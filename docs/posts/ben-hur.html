        <p><strong>First part</strong></p>
<p>I’m torn between finding it impressive and epic, and finding it a little dull. The music and scenery are awesome, but I haven’t been moved by any story development or character moment except when Arius announces that he’s adopted Judah. I have noticed some of the parallels between Judas’s story and that of Jesus, which seems to be part of the point of the story. There aren’t too many though, so it’s not coming off as really hokey. I’m looking forward to the second part because I know the chariot scene will be pretty cool, and I hope the story wraps up in an inspiring way.</p>
<p><strong>Second part</strong></p>
<p>Wow, that chariot scene. I can’t believe how dangerous they were able to make it seem. Especially when guys are getting run over, they don’t look like dummies, it’s terrifying.</p>
<p>The movie abruptly becomes almost entirely focused on Jesus, and for a non-Christian it could come across as shoehorned-in and a distraction from Judah’s story. But it’s a crucial element of Judah’s character resolution. After the race and after he finds his mother and sister as lepers, he is without hope, and to top it all off, when Esther tries to bring him to Christ for hope, Christ is sentenced and crucified. In this world of suffering and injustice, the only remedy is Jesus. So it’s not only appropriate that the lepers are healed at his moment of death, but it’s even more appropriate that Judah sees Christ forgive his enemies. I was very moved by the ending of this movie and I think it raises my opinion of the movie overall.</p>
