        <p>I once read somewhere that this movie makes no sense, and I don’t think that’s quite fair. But it certainly is a movie plagued by too many ideas and not enough good storytelling to glue them together. Sleepwalking and insect ESP are both fine characterizations for the heroine to have, but combining them just makes for a suspicious lack of one over the other at certain times in the film.</p>
<p>Overall it’s clearly the least good Dario Argento movie I’ve seen so far, but it’s still enjoyable even with its many faults. There are some shots that are so magical and 80’s and fantastical, that it makes the whole movie worth it at least as a historical document.</p>
<p>Jennifer Connelly is a very good actress when it comes to being defiant, exasperated, or determined, but she doesn’t seem to have any other emotions in her arsenal. This is true of <em>Phenomena</em>, and also of <em>Labyrinth</em> which was apparently only one year later.</p>
<p>There are some lines that are hilarious, like the awesome exchange between Jennifer and the woman when they’re going into her house near the end: “Do you live here alone?” “No.” The fact there is no follow-up or clarification until at least 30 seconds later was a dead giveaway that she’s the killer.</p>
<p>The ending was pretty tense and scary, and I liked that it took on a grossness that I have yet not seen in a giallo film. The cave and underwater scenes were especially frightening.</p>
<p>The music was great, of course. I especially liked the Iron Maiden song. Nothing amps you up while making sure no scene gets too scary like throwing some classic heavy metal into the scene.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
