        <p>This movie really grows on you. It’s quirky but too much. It’s a little boring but not too much. It’s funny but not hilarious. It’s cute but not precious. By the end I liked it, but it took me a while. It’s pretty clear that the story arc is gonna be “they can’t go through with destroying the town” but it’s interesting that it’s not the locals who raise the resistance, mostly, and it’s not a change of heart by Mcyntire, but rather eccentricity by Happer that effects the change in direction. In that sense it dismisses with all the cliches.</p>
<p>The final scenes where Mcyntire is looking out at Houston from his deck, and then the phone booth rings, with the music going… That’s cinema.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
