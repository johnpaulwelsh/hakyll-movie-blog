        <p>Itâ€™s got some good stuff. The performances are good, the sound work is good, the conspiracy is delightfully distant and barely matters except for the fact that it exists to be discovered. But something about it feels a little so-so for me. The bits of humor I liked, and the ending is kind of great. Seeing Philly in the 80s is also a nice bonus.</p>
<p>De Palma does slick moves like the overlaying faces on background scenes to signify listening, or the spinning camera, or the camera on the ceiling. But I feel like the movie should be a little bit better written to justify these fancy directorial tricks.</p>
