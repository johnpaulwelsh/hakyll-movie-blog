        <p>Am I crazy for liking this a lot? I wonder how much I’m inflating the score given that I know that barely any Argento films after <em>Opera</em> are considered great or even good, so my enjoyment of this movie is counting for more than it should. That might be it, but who cares? I’m not being graded on what I rate a movie.</p>
<p>It’s weird to see Argento tackle a story in an urban and suburban American setting. Sometimes it feels like a made-for-TV movie, especially the lighting which seems naturalistic but also too bright. The acting is pretty good, but in a so-bad-it’s-good sense sometimes (Piper Laurie goes full ham, and I’m torn on whether Asia Argento is realistic or bad). I like that David resembles the guy from <em>Stranger Things</em>, maybe those actors are related (NOTE: they are not).</p>
<p>The twist is good and the killings are fun, so that counts for a lot in my opinion. It almost feels like a redo of the twist for <em>Crystal Plumage</em>, where the apparent victim of an early crime is actually the culprit and there’s a big focus on misperception of a clue.</p>
<p>Not everything is good or so-bad-it’s-good, though. The relationship between Aura and David is a little creepy and exploitative, and I don’t really understand why Dario would cast his daughter as a 16 year old girl who takes her shirt off on camera. The worst thing is the music though, there are some score cues in the first half which feel totally inappropriate and corny. Imagine how good this movie would be if Goblin did the music, or even the guy from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer who did the music for <em>Opera</em>.</p>
<p>I was a little too disturbed by the fate of Nicholas, that will never not make me feel sick now that I’m a father.</p>
