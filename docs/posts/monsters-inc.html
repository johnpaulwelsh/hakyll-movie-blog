        <p>This viewing convinced me of its brilliance in a way that other viewings didn’t (I mean, 9 to 10 isn’t a big jump but still). It’s not as much of an adventure as my Pixar stereotype template led me to remember: Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Inside Out are probably the most obvious “awkward pairing set out on an adventure they didn’t plan on having” examples, and I assumed that this movie was the same but you actually get to see a lot more of how their society works before they start hopping through doors. Also the scream extractor is pretty scary.</p>
<p>The most important part of this viewing for me was watching it with my two daughters. The 20-month-old was laughing and pointing at the screen and generally having a great time. Meanwhile my 3.75-year-old one was scared and cuddling against me the entire time, especially after the CDA agents show up.</p>
<p>Boo is very cute but of indeterminate age. She can sing and use the potty, but she also looks and dresses and speaks like she’s maybe 22 months old.</p>
<p>Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfect casting decisions for these roles, like maybe the most perfect Pixar casting other than Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear.</p>
<p>The restaurant is called Harryhausen’s, that’s funny!</p>
<p>10/10</p>
