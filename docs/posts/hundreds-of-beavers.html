        <p>Simply amazing that they committed so hard to the joke. It actually takes a while for the beavers to become the primary thing being hunted. There’s a lot of video game DNA in this, not just the shopkeeper part but also the process of learning and development that he uses for his traps. And there’s a part near the end which must be a reference to “Shock Drop n’ Roll” from Mario Party.</p>
