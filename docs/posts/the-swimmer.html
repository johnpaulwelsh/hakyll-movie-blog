        <p>A very mature movie that held me firmly in its grasp the entire runtime. Following Ned’s swim from one end of the county to the other is a very clever way to build a story with no flashbacks but still hinged upon the mystery of what happened in the past. I really like the little bits and pieces of what you learn at each stop, of course, but I also think it’s just as interesting to see the different perspectives each pool host gives to his character. Early on they are all smiles, “how are ya” kinda back-slapping. JulieAnn is naive but a perfect POV for that part of the story. As we get closer to the final destination we see more dimensions of Ned’s character, but we also see people who know him more directly. The rich couple know he’s broke, the actress was his mistress, and perhaps surprisingly, the patrons of the public pool know him the best. The way the film unfolds reminds me of literature instead of film. There is a real thematic depth to this movie and I am intensely interested in learning more about the process of making it, because I hear that it was a bit of a passion project for Burt Lancaster.</p>
<p>Also, I went the whole movie thinking it was made in 1978 but apparently it was 1968! That line about dating through a computer matchmaker seems even more unbelievable in light of that. There is a grittiness and opulence that feels very 1970s.</p>
<p>Little things remain puzzling, and I love that they have no clear answer: * how old are his daughters if they are out getting in car accidents, but also the 20-year-old girl on the other side of the county was their babysitter? * where did Ned come from at the beginning of the story? Maybe this is his Sisyphean struggle and he’s doomed to repeat it. * what is the significance of the two/three years that he seems to have forgotten?</p>
