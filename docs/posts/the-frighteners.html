        <p>The best word for this movie is “bonkers.” Maybe also “rip roarin’ good time” would work as well.</p>
<p>Peter Jackson is a madman with the camera, and he gets really excellent over-the-top performance out of everybody, but especially the FBI man and adult Patricia.</p>
<p>I like that the movie doesn’t linger too long on the whole “frighteners” con-man operation that Frank runs. It takes just long enough to show what’s going on but then moves on to the rest of the plot.</p>
<p>The CGI is bad, but it’s also really expressive and interesting so it gets a pass.</p>
<p>There are some parts that are a little dumb, but they’re dumb in a cute way. Like how Frank gets to go back to earth at the end, for obvious but dubious reasons. And I think there are kind of a lot of scenes that linger on the FBI guy for extended periods of time; I suspect these become way less enjoyable on rewatches, and I even thought they went on a bit too long compared to the snappy pace of all the other events in the movie.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
