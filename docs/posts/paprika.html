        <p>Trippy, almost too trippy for its own sake. It’s very entertaining to watch, but I struggled a bit with identifying the story and themes underneath. Talking with Sully afterwards helped me realize that the story itself isn’t too complicated, it’s just that the visuals constantly obfuscate what “happens.” You can almost ignore everything you see and just pay attention to what people say, to get a better grasp of the plot.</p>
<p>Beyond the plot though, this movie is harder to tease out than <em>Perfect Blue</em> is. I think it’s more of a conventional story, in that the questions being posed for the audience are directly grappled with by the characters too. What are dreams? Why are they valuable? Can science go too far in the effort to help people? These questions aren’t definitively answered, but the fact that the bad guy feels one way about those questions and the good guys feel another way make it less complex than <em>Perfect Blue</em> is, which had more to “say” about fantasy vs. reality by specifically not taking sides.</p>
