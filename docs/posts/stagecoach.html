        <p>Just great. It feels stupid to say now, given that I’ve only seen maybe five American westerns, but this feels like THE American western.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable that no one character feels like the star or the lead. It’s truly an ensemble picture, although some of that comes from seeing so many familiar faces (John Wayne of course, but also the drunk and the coachman, who all three are in <em>Liberty Valance</em>!). Everybody’s story is clearly introduced, progressed, and resolved in a very economical manner. And it’s extremely easy to keep track of everybody, even though it’s such a big cast.</p>
<p>The baby subplot obviously got to me, especially since I was holding my own daughter as she slept the whole movie. It was funny to see them cut to the baby sleeping during the Indian chase, and look down and see my baby sleeping too. Gunshots don’t bother them either in real life or in the safety of my living room I guess.</p>
<p>The way everybody treats Dallas is also one of my favorite elements, it’s just great storytelling and human insight. Maybe I missed some dialogue at the beginning, but I like that they never explain why everyone hates her, but I always suspected it’s because she’s a prostitute.</p>
<p>I love the shot where the gambler is about to shoot the woman, but then his hand falls right before the calvary bugle sounds. It’s one of those things where as a younger viewer, I’d be confused as to why he’s going to kill her, but now I see that it’s because he wanted to protect her from the fate of bring captured by the Indians.</p>
<p>If I had to ding it for anything it’s that the shootout doesn’t feel as iconic as the rest of the movie does. But I can’t fault the filmmakers, they pulled off enough miracles for one movie. Plus, the musical score is a little repetitive.</p>
<p>The comments about the national debt and how “we need a businessman to run the country” are shockingly familiar to my own time, almost 90 years later.</p>
