        <p>Beautiful. Hilarious. Touching. Exciting.</p>
<p>The beginning has such sad and moving music, and even before you know what’s going on it was affecting.</p>
<p>What a great cast, but I’m especially impressed with Jimmy Stewart. He’s probably the only actor who could play Rance as both a leading man and as a put-upon underdog. It’s a genius portrayal.</p>
<p>I’ve now seen three John Wayne movies and every time it’s amazing to watch him do his thing. It’s such a familiar schtick – the swaggering walk, “pilgrim,” the half smile when he’s showing you who’s boss. But watching him actually do it doesn’t feel like I’m finally seeing the original article, it’s more like the John Wayne archetype pre-existed him, and he’s just the best one at doing it. It’s much like seeing the guy play Peabody, the boisterous (sometimes drunk) thespian type. That character exists in many movies and this one might contain the best example of it, but it feels worn-in and established already. Maybe I really need to see some of the early Wayne movies to see his style before it became iconic, because I’m sure the familiarity came to play a role in how Wayne portrayed himself in movies as he went along.</p>
<p>There’s a tension between the old-West way of doing things and the modern American way. But it’s not just displayed through Liberty and Rance, it’s there with Tom and Rance too. This is the kind of Western I need to keep watching.</p>
