        <p>There’s something about Disney films from the 60s and 70s that feel very slight. Like the story being told is too short to warrant a feature length, so every scene is padded out with Disney nonsense like chase scenes or musical passages. This one doesn’t suffer from that as much as some others (looking at you, <em>The Sword in the Stone</em>), but there’s still some of it. For example, the halfway point of the movie is the archery tournament, but it doesn’t really feel like the story has begun yet by that point.</p>
<p>The animation in this movie is really good, and all the animals are adorable (especially the bunny children). Maid Marian is pretty hot, for a cartoon fox.</p>
<p>The real draw here is Prince John, he’s absolutely hilarious and an instantly memorable villain.</p>
