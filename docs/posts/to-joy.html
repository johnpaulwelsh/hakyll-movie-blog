        <p>Surprisingly good. The whole story is pretty mundane, especially in comparison to <em>Wild Strawberries</em>, but I must say it’s effective. This frame device is a billion times better than the one in <em>A Ship to India</em>.</p>
<p>Seeing this movie at this time in my life (one month after my daughter was born) made me identify with the film more than usual. I’m glad the loss of the wife isn’t dwelt on too long to milk the tragedy for a lot of tears. I guess that’s why the ending is the way it is, although it feels a little tonally weird to have “Ode to Joy” performed so soon after he finds out that his wife died (I assume this was soon after). Thematically it makes sense, and the conductor’s speech is beautiful, but it still feels a little off emotionally.</p>
<p>One quibble: she does NOT look 9 months pregnant with twins in that pre-hospital scene.</p>
