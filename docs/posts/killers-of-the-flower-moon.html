        <p>It’s really really good. Probably one of the best immersions into a movie I’ve had in a while, given that it’s more than three hours long and I never really thought about time passing while watching it.</p>
<p>The frustrating thing for me about Scorsese movies is, that I feel like there’s nothing really to talk about other than “it was really good.”</p>
<p>I think the slow reveal of the fact that Ernest is committing such evil deeds is really amazing stuff. For a long portion of the movie I was operating under the impression that Ernest would be a good guy, but it’s even better that he doesn’t end up as the bad guy either. He’s complicated, and that conversation at the end with his wife where he answers her question with “insulin” is the perfect capstone to the whole movie.</p>
<p>What an inspired ending! The radio play where Marty himself shows up is a ballsy decision, but I think he earned it. And it really makes you think about the fact that it’s easy to see a story like this as pure, safe, white suburban entertainment, but it’s all too real and that should wake us up.</p>
<p>There were two young people in the back row for about 2/3 of the movie, whispering and sometimes giggling for almost the whole time they were there, and then they left. I just don’t get people like that. Thank goodness they left when they did, which I think was right before the FBI shows up.</p>
