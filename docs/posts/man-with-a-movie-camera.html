        <p>If there weren’t a description at the beginning stating what kind of experiment this is, I don’t think I’d appreciate this film as much.</p>
<p>It forced me to think of filmmaking from a technical point of view in a way very little has done for me before.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition is really striking. Manufacture and sales; sleeping and vision, marriage, divorce, and vehicle movement.</p>
<p>How did they do all these techniques in 1929? Split screen, stop motion, flickering editing, slomo, freeze frame, reverse footage how, layered images…</p>
<p>This film contains a focus on the cameraman that feels revolutionary, but it’s still somewhat artificial because there’s another cameraman behind the camera that’s capturing the image. That’s a fun little thing to think about.</p>
<p>How do you even rate this?</p>
<p>8/10</p>
