        <p>NOTE: I had to watch this across two nights, so the first paragraph is my thoughts before finishing the movie.</p>
<p>So Harry is actually Johnny right? I wonder if they will close the plot hole of the fact that Angel doesn’t have amnesia or a mysterious past. I like it so far, even if I turn out to be right about the twist. Maybe a 7/10 thus far. Now that I know the music is Trevor Jones (<em>Labyrinth</em>) it’s really obvious, there’s something uniquely 80s synthy about his work.</p>
<p>I was right, Cyphre is the devil and Harry is Johnny. It’s interesting to watch a twist-ending movie for the first time while also being pretty sure of the twist, it lets you see themes and symbolism which normally would confuse you or pass you by.</p>
<p>It’s hilarious that Cyphre is more comfortable sitting in the back of a church than Harry is. There’s a small comparison drawn between voodoo rituals and the Black church in Brooklyn which is pretty ballsy to draw.</p>
<p>For a movie which seems pretty mainstream, it’s actually very effed up and gruesome. But not in a way that I think is inappropriate. Even the incest twist feels right for this kind of sweaty supernatural thriller.</p>
<p>The sex scene with Epiphany (wow what a telling name they gave her!) goes from hot to NOT pretty fast. But since I knew already she was his daughter it was already pretty NOT.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
