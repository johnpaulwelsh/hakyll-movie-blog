        <p>This movie watching experience is one of the most conflicted ones I’ve had in a while, probably since <em>Dead Ringers</em>. I think it’s probably true that nobody can be truly objective about a piece of art, but I’m certain that that’s true for this film.</p>
<p>I watched it many times as a kid, of course, but I also read the book at the beginning of this year, so this was a fresh watching experience in many ways. Additionally this is the first time I wasn’t watching on a battered old VHS tape or on SD Disney channel or something. So here are some scattered thoughts about what I liked or loved:</p>
<p>The animation and voice acting for Alice is my favorite thing about this movie. She’s so expressive and realistic that I honestly can’t believe it. There’s a part during the trial where she goes “oh, no!” in response to the UnBirthday song starting up again, and she facepalms and drags her face down across her hand a little and her nose gets pulled up a bit in the process, and I think that’s just amazing detail work. Something I wouldn’t expect to see from Disney until probably <em>The Little Mermaid</em> I guess? Like could <em>The Aristocats</em> or <em>Robin Hood</em> having such a subtle and realistic human physical expression? I simply can’t imagine it.</p>
<p>Similarly to above, I think the animation is stunning and each little part, when taken just on its own aesthetic terms, is a master work. I think it’s a fabulous coincidence that the Disney movie I watched prior to this one is <em>The Three Caballeros</em> because that one also surprised me in how colorful, memorable, and groundbreaking the visuals are. I couldn’t help but smile like an idiot when the card soldiers were marching and shuffling and whistling. It’s Disney through and through, which to some means being fluffy and insubstantial, but I just marvel at it.</p>
<p>The music (the score, mostly, but also some of the songs) is very forceful and basically omnipresent. Many times it emphasizes the dialogue in a Mickey-Mousing kind of way. This is especially true when the Queen shows up initially.</p>
<p>When Alice has some time to sit down and have a good cry, I nearly cried too. Not necessarily because I emotionally bonded with her about her struggle during the film (see below about this point), but because Disney has a magical ability to make me a big old sap when a character is singing a lament to himself or herself. It doesn’t even have to be a song - the part in <em>The Aristocats</em> (sorry, my daughter loves the movie so I watch it constantly now) where Dutchess is explaining why she has to go back to her mistress, it has this very particular somber quality that I, for some reason, find very affective on my emotions. Same goes for “Not in Nottingham” in <em>Robin Hood</em>.</p>
<p>Some of the humor really tickles me, especially the visual gags during the tea party, the mama bird’s constant shouting of “SERPENT!”, and the Dodo’s solution for getting rid of the “monster”.</p>
<p>And now for some things that make me hestitate, or I just flat out don’t enjoy.</p>
<p>Everybody is so <em>mean</em> to poor Alice, and she doesn’t really demonstrate that she deserves it. Now this is coming mostly from my reading the book recently. What I got from the book is, Alice is a know-it-all little girl who thinks that makes her a grown-up, and many (or all) of the encounters she has in Wonderland are meant to get her to build up some humility and some toughness for the adult world that actually awaits her. But instead of something like “The Phantom Tollbooth” which is helping form the young protagonist through silliness in pursuit of learning, this is kind of like a dream-logic version of washing the kid’s mouth out with soap. It’s supposed to be abrasive, but here’s the key thing, Alice is supposed to <em>kinda</em> deserve it. Or at least, she needs to be bringing it on herself as she flits from one scene to the other, giving herself little pep-talks that show us, the reader, that she doesn’t really know how adults think.</p>
<p>But in this movie, she’s kind of blindly following this rabbit and being rude to many of the people who she encounters. Not as much as I remembered her being in previous watches, but somewhat. For example does she really need to yell about not being a monster when she’s stuck in the Rabbit’s house, rather than try to get out herself independent of what those idiots outside are saying? I recall in the book she’s simultaneously more self-pitying and more resourceful when it comes to getting out of sticky situations. Many other examples exist, some more egregious than others. But I think she just isn’t clever enough in the movie to actually warrant all these hard lessons.</p>
<p>Another thing is how chaotic the whole story is when you see it playing out in front of you for 75 brisk minutes. Chaos doesn’t always mean bright flashing madness, I would argue that the dark forest right after the tea party is maybe the most chaotic part outside of the big finale, because the little derpy animals, while cute, are all just interrupting Alice’s character arc one after another. She’s trying to sit down and realize she’s in over her head, but they keep squeaking or digging or sweeping right across her storyline.</p>
<p>My least favorite part begins with Alice floating through the keyhole, and ends with the departure from the presence of Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum. It’s feels strange to say it, but I think the movie slows down considerably in that spot, and it’s also a dense section of meanness and annoyingness.</p>
<p>My pros outweigh my cons, but in all I think this is a flawed achievement by Disney and might be the best example between the 1930s and 1970s of why Disney can be seen as an American treasure by some, but an unfocused glaring mess by others.</p>
<p>But… why do I like this movie more than <em>Paprika</em>, another fantastical animated film which has a basic story underneath very chaotic and almost random visual happenings? It could be any number of reasons, but going back to my statement above about objectivity, I think it’s just this: I watched <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> as a kid, and I didn’t do so with <em>Paprika</em>. There’s really nothing about this movie which is more successful than <em>Paprika</em> on normal measurement standards: it has much less of a story, its randomness is certainly more random than in <em>Paprika</em> (at least the parade has an explanation!), and without having read the original source material for <em>Paprika</em> I would assume it’s a more faithful adaptation than <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> is of its source books.</p>
<p>But… I like <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> more. Is it because I have a prejudice against anime in my old age? Is it because I’ve seen <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> more times than <em>Paprika</em>? No, I really do think it’s just because <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> locked itself into my brain as a child, and there’s something about doing that which cannot be undone.</p>
<p>Finally… I officially like the book more than the movie. So there.</p>
