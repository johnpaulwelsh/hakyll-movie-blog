        <p>Rewatching with my wife, so I was almost able to see the movie through a first-timer’s eyes, in addition to knowing the twist that was coming the whole time. I thought the movie was more mind-blowing when I was a teenager (no surprise there), but I think it still holds up. One of the best parts of the script is that the mystery of “who is Keyser Soze” isn’t introduced for at least 20 minutes. It would be much hokier if the first scene was some guy whispering “Keyser… Soze…” and then dying, or some ham-handed such nonsense. But the movie makes its case for being compelling even before the Soze mystery is introduced, because the actors sell their characters so well.</p>
<p>Also talk about a movie that’s not okay to watch in a post-#MeToo world. Directed by Bryan Singer, and starring Kevin Spacey? I’m surprised there isn’t a tell-all New York Times piece alleging a child-porn ring in the background of this movie set.</p>
