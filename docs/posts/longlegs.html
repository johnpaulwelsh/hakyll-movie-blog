        <p>It scared me! I actually regretted starting it because I realized about 10 minutes in that I was in the mood for a horror-topic movie, but not necessarily a horrific movie. But I made it through, with only two lamps to help me through. And a rosary.</p>
<p>Nicolas Cage is a magnetic screen presence and while I think the movie would be significantly less hyped if he weren’t in it, it’s better that he is than it being played by some nobody. The fact that he just comes out and says Hail Satan brings a level of camp to the movie which was kinda always there, but that line justifies and solidifies it.</p>
<p>I can’t help but see the movie as being a mixture of three much better movies, those being <em>Se7en</em>, <em>Cure</em>, and <em>Hereditary</em>. It’s still pretty good, but it’s very clear that Osgood Perkins has seen all three of those.</p>
<p>The movie kind of forgets that Lee is a little bit psychic, that never comes up after she points Carter toward the right building at the farmhouse which is pretty close to halfway through.</p>
<p>The dolls were absolutely the creepiest part of this movie and the main reason that I think it’s valuable as its own thing.</p>
<p>It’s crazy that so many intriguing plot threads are solved with such a simple story when the mom recounts what happened back on her daughter’s ninth birthday.</p>
<p>It was very annoying that twice in the first 20 minutes (once at the house in the neighborhood they were canvassing, and once at her own house), Lee found herself alone and confronting a dangerous killer, and she decides to move from her safe spot with her gun out, alone, instead of calling for backup.</p>
