        <p>Below average in every way. Gore is whatever, plot and lore are just barely interesting, and the sense of “look how cool we are” is painfully cliche.</p>
<p>The beginning of the movie, before the priests show up, is pretty much just boring. The music when the team is suiting up and walking to the house is hilariously repetitive. And my god, I’ve never seen a bigger waste of bullets in any movie.</p>
<p>The dialogue is the corniest crap I’ve heard in a long time. The “rules” are by far the worst, as if people actually talk like that. It was almost made worse by the couple times that James Woods says something honestly hilarious, like basically any time he’s talking to the young priest. Each of those nuggets of dialogue make me wish the rest of the movie was like that.</p>
<p>There are some charms to how brainless and typical the movie is, but they could never bring it up to “so bad it’s good” territory. Honestly I think my favorite part was seeing Sheryl Lee play yet another used and abused woman with crazy eyes.</p>
