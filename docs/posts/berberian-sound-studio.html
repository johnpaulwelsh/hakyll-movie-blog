        <p>I really liked this, even though it’s slow and ambiguous like modern middling horror movies often are. I don’t think this is a horror movie at all, not in the traditional sense. On the surface it’s a drama where a sensitive Brit comes to do sound work for a movie sort of like <em>Suspiria</em>, and has trouble with the workplace culture and the content of the film. And actually that by itself, with nothing else beneath, is done really well and I enjoyed it a lot. The decision to never show the film footage was genius, the point is not to make us as uncomfortable as Gilderoy is, it’s to watch how he’s made to feel uncomfortable. I also love that Gilderoy looks so plain and unassuming, he doesn’t even seem like an actor, just a normal guy.</p>
<p>It’s just fun to see how they pull off foley work, it’s not something you often see in movies.</p>
<p>It’s a brilliant move to make the director choose his next voice actress by looking at photos, and not by auditioning screams. So when Elisa ends up being a poor screamer, it really hits home that this director is making decisions with his penis and not his brain.</p>
<p>So aside from being a good and compelling character study, what’s the point of the movie? I think it’s to show how horrible things can happen in the real world, but we’re more comfortable seeing them in the movies instead. The letters from Mum make that clear, Gilderoy pines for going back home where it’s supposedly quaint and friendly, but even there, brutality can occur, whether in the natural world or in human society. The horror movie’s director speaks the theme of the movie too, how he feels the duty to show what happened to the witches even though it’s terrible.</p>
<p>It would be very easy to assume this movie exists to be yet a version of “yep, he went crazy, isn’t that so zany?” I think that undercuts how good and interesting this movie really is. If you go in assuming that, then the movie sucks, because the crazy scary stuff takes so long to materialize and because the ending is so ambiguous. Just because a movie ends with a symbolic sequence and not a fully grounded realistic one, doesn’t mean the conclusion for the audience to draw is that they should doubt the veracity of what they’ve seen leading up to it. I kind of want to rewatch <em>Enemy</em> with that frame of mind, now that I think about it.</p>
