        <p>This might be tied with <em>Deep Red</em> as my favorite Argento movie so far. It’s got great characters, including a lot of random folks who are memorable but serve basically no purpose (does The Professor do anything that God or the private eye couldn’t have done?). The characters and various other scenes in general provide a butt-ton of red herrings, which is exactly what you want in a movie like this. It’s also got really hilarious moments, especially anything with The Professor or the super-gay private eye. The leadups to the killings are actually really tense and I was on the edge of my seat when the cousin went up into that unfinished attic area.</p>
<p>I also think the movie has a legitimately interesting twist at the end. Even knowing that Argento’s gialli typically have unassuming women as the killers, driven mad by past trauma, I was still caught off-guard by the reveal in this movie. I don’t really care about all the logistical questions one might raise, such as “how did Roberto not know anything about this woman’s upbringing before marrying her, or how did her cousin not know anything about it either?” or “did she actually have that pendant any other time in the movie to establish that it could be her?” I think this officially makes me a giallo fanatic, because something about 1970s Italian mystery-thrillers just gets a pass on all these little faults, because they’re so freaking stylish and exciting. It’s hard to imagine this movie rivaling <em>Suspiria</em> or <em>Phenomena</em> in terms of style, but it just about does.</p>
<p>It’s even got corny 1970s “technology” like how you can see the final image that an eye retina saw before death. Like come on, even if that were true, how could it capture four “frames” of a swinging fly pendant when the human eye doesn’t capture information in discrete chunks like a film camera does?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, I only now remembered that there’s the whole plot point that Roberto never killed the man in the theater! What a great twist.</p>
<p>The performance of the woman who plays Nina gives an amazing performance, not only when being crazy at the end (licking her lips reminded me a lot of Barty Crouch Jr. from <em>Harry Potter</em>) but also when she’s playing the concerned and grieving wife for the rest of the movie. It’s kinda hammy like a lot of foreign acting can be sometimes, but it’s also so good that it transcends that limitation and becomes really impressive.</p>
<p>Watching this on Plex streaming had some issues, with the ad breaks and the few lines of dialogue in un-subtitled Italian near the end when the killer is giving the killer monologue. But all things considered it was a good experience.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
