        <p>Look, it’s part of my childhood okay? I can appreciate that it’s not amazing, but I do think it’s very good and there are some real achievements here. Technically, the puppetry is top-rate and really imaginative (Hoggle by himself is kind of mind-blowing the more you look at him). I think the songs are actually kinda just okay, but of course I love them anyway (espcially the use of “Underground” over the opening and closing credits). I think the single best contribution to film that this movie provides is the hoarders scene. It’s creepy and anxiety-inducing from a plot perspective, but it also gets at what you could consider to be the “theme” of the movie, which is the hostility of clinging to childhood and selfish fantasy. It’s not merely “time to grow up”, it’s also a bit of “look at what you could turn into if you don’t grow up.” I find it very affecting, and the way it ends with the walls crumbling down of the bedroom set is freaking awesome.</p>
<p>Sir Didymus cracks me up every time. Jennifer Connelly isn’t a great actress but in some places she has just the right amount of know-it-all-ness and exasperation.</p>
