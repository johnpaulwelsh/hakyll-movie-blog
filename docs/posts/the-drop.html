        <p>College friends are a mistake.</p>
<p>This is a really funny movie. Lots of sex jokes, but only because the characters are disordered and have no healthy relationships. I really enjoyed watching it.</p>
<p>I like that both the man and woman are the main characters, not just the man (although we seem to follow his frame of mind a little more often than hers). Too bad about the in-home birth, or else they would have been a fully normal couple. But haha! Unexpected family values!</p>
<p>There are definitely some spots that are emotionally silly and where things happen just for the laughs (like the guy cracking open the coconut to mirror what the girl did earlier, or how nobody seems to care the next morning about how terrible the rehearsal dinner was). But Iâ€™m glad these moments are few and far between.</p>
<p>The scene on the boat is overall my favorite scene. So much cringe.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
