        <p>What a strange film, weirdly compelling so I think all things considered, I liked it. You can hardly call it a giallo, but idk what to call it. It’s so aggressively unfriendly to the audience, with the camera angles, music, and bizarre editing pace (scenes just collide into each other).</p>
<p>It’s got a pretty ballsy twist, but I really don’t know what to make of it. There’s zero insight into anybody’s emotions or psychology, they just act and react. It’s like the movie doesn’t want you to ever be sure what kind of story you’re watching, or whether anybody is guilty or innocent of the implied crimes.</p>
<p>The mutant chicken plot line is so creepy, I kind of loved it.</p>
<p>Subtitles were questionable, weird verb tenses.</p>
<p>PQ was pretty bad at times, felt like vhs quality.</p>
<p>6/10</p>
