        <p>Edward Ball is an evil man.</p>
<p>What an amazing accomplishment to make me feel unending dread for 100 straight minutes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if there’s a plot. It doesn’t matter if there’s any logic to what happens. It’s an exercise in building Ana maintaining child like fear and holy balls, it works splendidly.</p>
<p>Squinting made it worse because it was easier to see stuff!</p>
<p>At first I thought the purpose of the movie was to demonstrate how in the face of absent parents, cartoons are the only comfort. But, the movie is either much more, or much less than that.</p>
<p>It’s almost worse that you don’t get to see anybody get scared for the longest time. It’s like how in a good comedy, nobody laughs because they’re all playing it straight. This movie is meant to scare the audience, and honestly I think that’s the main purpose for its existence.</p>
<p>From when the dad says “look under the end” until the end of the movie I was watching through my fingers.</p>
<p>When Kevin stabbed his eye and blood was on the door I almost got really angry. Becoming a dad has made me much less forgiving of careless child endangerment, even if it’s fictional.</p>
<p>I can’t even begin to understand how someone edits a movie like this.</p>
