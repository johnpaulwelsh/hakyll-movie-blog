        <p>I don’t know how representative this movie is for the wuxia subgenre in general, but I wasn’t terribly impressed. Obviously there are strong points, mostly the action sequences and the musical score. It’s also interesting that the movie has things to say about gender roles and about love vs. violence, it makes it feel like either a very modern take on a classic story, or else displays a depth of character that those old stories always had, but Western audiences never realized they had. I would also accuse the movie of being sleep-inducing, but not in not a terrible way. That flashback was quite boring, unfortunately. Honestly I was ablt to take almost all of the movie seriously except for the goofy flying around, I usually don’t let style choices take me out of the experience but it really did for me this time. I liked the action in <em>Five Deadly Venoms</em> even though they were flying around like cornballs, so I’m not sure what the difference is here.</p>
