        <p>A slow burn, but it turned out really interesting and bleak, while also darkly funny. I had to totally change gears in my head when the main character’s ghost popped up off the ground, and then I started to realize what kind of movie this is.</p>
<p>Maybe the most obvious allegory movie I’ve seen in a while, though what it’s an allegory of is not quite obvious. I think it’s trying to say something about brilliant and dangerous people who orchestrate their plans from a distance to destroy lives for financial gain. The man in the hat seems to be working for somebody who wants both wings of the mine union to lose their power and succumb to the company, so an elaborate scheme is hatched which results in four deaths, and perposterously it all goes according to plan. But the ghosts allow us to suffer with the victims, to wonder why, oh God, why? But never get an answer.</p>
<p>It bothered me that the poor kid sees so many deaths and doesn’t seem to respond until the very end when he’s crying and running away. But I’m certain that the kid is a stand-in for all honest people who are witnessing senseless violence and atrocities. I would have felt a little less sad for him if the man were not his father, but that just twists the knife for me.</p>
<p>The music is awesome, I can’t believe this movie came out in the early 60s because this sounds like a late-60s or early-70s experimental film score.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
