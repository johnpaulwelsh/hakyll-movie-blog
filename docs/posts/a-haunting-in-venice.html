        <p>One of those movies where I wonder if it was even worth making. It’s not hard to watch, but it’s also not very compelling except whenever there’s a scary part (the bathroom jump scare is really good, and the creepy hallways from the first-person camera when they go to the basement is quite modern) or during the reveal of the crime at the end. I would give the first half of the movie less than 5/10 - too many dutch angles and scares covering up the total lack of story or interesting detective work. But the second half is more like a 6/10 once we get past the boring interviews of the suspects.</p>
