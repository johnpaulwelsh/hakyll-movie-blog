        <p>Watched it a theatre with friends, what a treat. One of the funniest movies of the 1980s. When you’re really paying attention to every line of dialogue, it’s amazing how much of it makes me laugh. One thing I thought about this time is that the group of kids who I think of as the “main cast” is not limited to the young kids, or the young kids plus one older kid. Every kid who goes in to that restaurant is a Goonie, and it’s amazing that I have such fond feelings and memories for all seven Goonies. <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> can’t get away with that, they kill off two members of the gang to make it easy on themselves in that movie.</p>
<p>The scenes on the pirate ship after the Fratellis show up kind of drag a little in terms of pacing, but I don’t care. Iconic film.</p>
