        <p>Fun 80s action comedy. Eddie Murphy is good but not great, surprisingly. I felt that a lot of his long comedic bits of dialogue were kind of forced. Judge Reinhold is a goober and that’s the best word for it. It was fun to see Jonathan Banks as a scumbag hitman back when he had hair. I’m surprised there wasn’t some kind of final “this is for you Mikey” kind of sendoff, it seems that they forget about him 25 minutes before the end of the movie.</p>
