        <p>Pretty much exactly what it should be, and what I wanted it to be. It’s funny, loaded with references, and just enjoyable to watch. Mario games aren’t good because they have a solid story, they’re good because they’re fun to play. So all this movie needed to be was fun to watch, and it is.</p>
<p>Somehow they got across the feeling of playing a platforming game, especially in the first half when Peach and Mario are jumping around like crazy people.</p>
<p>And the karts! They really got the vibe of playing Mario Kart, and a lot of the details of Super Smash Bros. too (like DK’s fighting moves).</p>
<p>The music was also top-tier, there was something magical about hearing those musical cues in a movie setting with full orchestration. But not like an orchestral cover - those usually don’t do anything for me, like what you can find with Zelda score played by an orchestra.</p>
<p>Also Bowser was kind of perfectly goofy, thank goodness for Jack Black.</p>
<p>Suicidal insane Luma is the most obvious “for the adults” part of it, but I don’t care I still loved it.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
