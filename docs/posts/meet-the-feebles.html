        <p>This is a nightmare.</p>
<p>There are parts that are funny. It’s really obvious that this is a joke on <em>The Muppet Show</em>. There are a lot of corrolaries, such as the frog, the big-boned primadonna, the rat, and the blue thing who is romantically-involved with a chicken. Though, the elephant reminded me a lot of <em>Monty Python</em>, both because of his accent and because his design is reminiscent of Terry Gilliam’s cutouts. And some of the lines were really funny, especially the puns involving the fly reporter. I also enjoyed the Vietnam flashback (especially the horribly racist designs for the Vietcong, but also tha they spoke like intellectuals).</p>
<p>I also have to admit that technically, it’s an astounding achievement. I’ve never seen puppets look so expressive with such a small amount of actual articulation. It’s not a really complicated puppet like what you see on other shows or movies, and it’s not like most of the characters are small hand puppets which can be very dextrously controlled for maximum effectiveness (Yoda). Instead I think Jackson’s direction and the set design come together to make everything feel alive in a way I’ve never quite seen before.</p>
<p>But almost all of the positives are outweighed by two negatives: it’s mean-spirited and it’s gross. In some ways it’s exactly what I feared it would be when beforehand I got the impression of “edgy Muppets.” The sense of humor is just about as mature as a Newgrounds flash animation. The chaos and emotional turmoil is pretty hard to watch too. I think people think of <em>Network</em> as a brutally effective satire, and it probably works because it’s clever because otherwise it might be too harrowing to bear otherwise. I think <em>Meet the Feebles</em> is trying to do the same thing, but it’s just heavy-handed about everything without making the viewer think. It’s like show-business satire from people who aren’t in show business, but have watched other satires too many times.</p>
<p>I just don’t want to see an animal puppet make a porno, or vomit all over the stage, or stick a needle in its arm. It’s just nasty and juvenile and I kinda feel bad for any group of young adults who felt compelled to put their creative efforts into it. Seeing Heidi cry without a top and roll around on the ground was just too pathetic, I felt bad while watching it.</p>
<p>Also how the heck did anybody give Peter Jackson the money to make this?</p>
<p>I have to admit, the songs were good. Especially “Sodomy”, shockingly.</p>
