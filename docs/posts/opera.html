        <p>I liked a lot of this, but I was also confused or put off by some. The score was very subdued whenever it wasn’t opera music (awesome) or heavy metal (kinda lame), though I guess I enjoyed the moodiness and calm.</p>
<p>I seriously don’t understand the motive for the murderer. Something about he was kept as a sex slave by her mother? There’s hardly any information given about her mother or about the flashbacks, so I don’t really understand it.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t all negative. The stuff with the crows is awesome. The stalking and murder scenes are excellent, especially the one in the apartment with the “detective” and the bullet through the peephole. That setup is one of the best sequences in any Argento movie. I really liked the side characters (costume designer, little girl, director). And I think the lead does a great job of being pretty and scared.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that in a movie about an opera singer, there is so much emphasis on eyes and vision.</p>
<p>And with this, I’ve now seen all the well-regarded Argento films. It’s been a wild ride. I think my favorites are still Four Flies, Deep Red, and Suspiria. But upon rewatch es I might warm up more to some of his others.</p>
