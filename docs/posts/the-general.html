        <p>A great movie because of how ambitious and expensive it is, not necessarily because it’s the pinnacle of comedy. I laughed more at Sherlock Jr and Seven Chances, but I was impressed most by this one. It’s cute when the girl starts trying to help on the train, including sweeping up. Pretty ballsy to make a comedy film on the side of the South during the Civil War, without even a hint of clarification about who was the right side of the conflict. But I think it’s purer that way, it’s interesting to see Northern armymen being clumsy and hapless for a change.</p>
