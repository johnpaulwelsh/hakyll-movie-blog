        <p>Watched it with motion smoothing on, it made me almost give it a 6/10 for being cheaply made, but then I realized it wasn’t the movies fault.</p>
<p>A perfectly serviceable version of the play, that I already saw an earlier movie version of. I thought it was unnecessary to show the woman drinking poison and dying instead of just mentioning it. And couldn’t she have just jumped or kill herself some other way that is less painful?</p>
<p>The best part is the shift in tone when the family starts suspecting the inspector isn’t real. The music gets quiet and it really feels like anything could happen next. I found the old movie’s daughter more convincing in her disgust for her parents’ generation.</p>
<p>Overall, I prefer the old one but if someone only watched this, I wouldn’t tell them to make up for anything by watching the older one.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
