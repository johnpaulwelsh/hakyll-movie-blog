        <p>One of the funniest movies I’ve ever seen. Maybe a little bit too long because near the end it becomes a littlee exhausting to laugh so much. But the same thing applies to <em>The Blues Brothers</em> and I can’t imagine docking points from that movie, so I shant for this one.</p>
<p>I don’t even really know what to say. I did laugh extra hard at the pun on “Witherspoon” because it happened so late in the film and I don’t think a single pun occurred before that, so it was maybe the most fresh pun ever put into a film.</p>
<p>Cary Grant is a miraculous actor. Physical comedy, facial expressions, line delivery, wordless noises, he can do it all.</p>
<p>It’s incredible how many little details are thrown in to flesh out the characters which don’t seem to actually matter until much later. The fact that Mortimer is a play critic doesn’t make a difference at all until the last fourth of the film when the cop and Witherspoon turn it into the biggest inconvenience that Mortimer has yet faced.</p>
<p>The dark scene is absolutely incredible. So inventive, and amazing from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>10/10</p>
