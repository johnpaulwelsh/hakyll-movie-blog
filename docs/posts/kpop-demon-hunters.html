        <p>I don’t wanna be too hard on it because when it’s good it’s really quite good. But let me begin with the negatives because they are very prominent.</p>
<p>The animation is a really unappealing combination of ultra-polished CG, stop-motion, and the aesthetic of smooth little plastic pachinko toys.</p>
<p>The opening 15 mins or so it is pretty hard to stomach because the editing is way too hyperactive and the writing is cramped. I think if they made the opening a little longer and less of an anime sizzle reel, and more of a proper introduction to the lore and the characters, it’d feel more like a worthy piece of original IP and less like an abandoned movie tie-in with something else. Like who is Celine? And how exactly does a demon father a child? Btw that reminds me of Shion from <em>Higurashi</em> which is always nice.</p>
<p>The lyrics too… They work fine as pop song lyrics, but as movie musical lyrics they’re far too on-the-nose. If these were all needle-drops instead of original songs, it would feel like “Seven Nation Army” on top of <em>Suicide Squad</em> or something equally cringey.</p>
<p>But the good now! The message of the movie is really excellent. The use of shame as a tool for controlling the demon army is unique and intriguing. Some of the things that they said during the secret meetings at night were really insightful (also Kylo-Rey vibes which I appreciated).</p>
<p>And the songs… Good! Golden is a worthy hit pop song. The boy band being evil is very funny because it helps show the bad side of pop idol fandom in a friendly way. The comedy is very well tuned too, though seeing typical 2D anime facial expressions on 3D models made me think I was looking at those horrendous Labubu dolls.</p>
<p>“Once More With Feeling” is the single most obvious predecessor to this.</p>
