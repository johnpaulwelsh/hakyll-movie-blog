        <p>Kind of like <em>Paris, Texas</em> where I definitely liked it, but the reputation precedes itself so strongly that I feel like I’m missing something by not being head over heels in love with it. I also wonder if I would love the things I do love about it quite as much if I didn’t know already that some people worship this film. For example the images are very striking and the colors are gorgeous. The amount of times that a scene is being shot through glass or through water/rain is kind of a lot, but it never gets old. Similar to the use of “California Dreamin’”, I thought I would have gotten sick of it but I never did.</p>
<p>But I must say I’m confused by the story, does the first woman with the wig really just stop mattering to the whole story after she takes her wig off? And the first cop disappears after he bumps into the short-haired girl? I almost suspected that they were the same people as the later couple, or at least one of them was, and I didn’t notice the similarity. So in one sense, this is just two movies which don’t really feel like they could stand on their own, but together they’re somehow better? I want to argue that’s not true, but honestly I think some kind of magic is going on in this movie where it is true.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s a spiritual similarity to it. It’s not episodic like <em>Pulp Fiction</em> is, where some things have crossover but otherwise it’s three or four stories strung together by a mood. For this film it’s almost like the same story being told in two ways with two couples. There are so many little thematic links, like airplanes and stewardesses, the Circle K, cops who are lovesick, etc.</p>
<p>Going back to the point of “would I like this if I want in blind?”, I think the whimsical romantic mood that these characters exhibit is something I theoretically shy away from, but I must say it won me over in most senses. I laughed quite a bit when officer 663 was talking to his stuffed animals and dish towels.</p>
<p>The performances and the camera framing are one in the same, in a way I’ve never seen before. In particular with short-haired girl: she never sits still, and the camera acts the same way when it’s pointed at her. It’s very intimate, very “in her head” while also making her mental state a little mysterious.</p>
<p>Do I want to go out and read about this movie, to learn why others love it so much or why it made such a big splash in the 90s? Or do I kinda want to watch it again in one year as a little callback to the movie itself?</p>
<p>Given what the movie ends up leaving as an impact on the viewer, there’s actually quite a lot of time spent watching Indian men kind of shlub around and get prepared for some drug trafficking. Is that the first-half equivalent of all the time spent watching short-haired girl clean an apartment that isn’t hers?</p>
<p>Also I need to go on record that the short-haired girl is very beautiful, and has some of the most expressive eyes I’ve ever seen in an actress.</p>
