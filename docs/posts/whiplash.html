        <p>Simply exhilarating. One of the best endings in all of movies, but secretly one of the most confusing. The reaction shot of the dad looking through the curtain with confusion and fear in his eyes can be taken so many ways. Has Andrew decided to be the best anyway? Does he support Fletcher in his abusive techniques? Is he just sticking it in Fletcher eye this one time? Are they partners or adversaries?</p>
<p>The abuse is a lot less funny when you’re older. I mean it’s never funny, but you nervous laugh when you’re younger as if it’s a “South Park” episode. But as I’m older I just see Fletcher for the scumbag he is. Never forget he lied about Casey’s death, that’s the most important detail and I’m sure Andrew never forgets it.</p>
<p>This is the kind of movie that changes you into a jazz appreciater, even if you never cared at all before. Watching that performance of caravan at the end, I felt like I couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>The score has no drumming after he gets kicked out of the conservatory. That’s neat.</p>
<p>Fletcher totally stole the sheet music at that performance where Andrew took core seat.</p>
<p>Andrew speaks only in “I” language on his date with Nicole. It’s clear from that first date that he’s not gonna be right for her, it’s surprising that she doesn’t notice at first.</p>
