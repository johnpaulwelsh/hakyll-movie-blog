        <p>Due to how short it is, it doesn’t have the same weight as the other films I’ve seen by Buster Keaton. And the story doesn’t really pay off much in terms of what happens with Dead Shot Dan. But otherwise this is just a really tight and perfectly executed bit of comedy. The elevator gag at the end is one of my favorite things I’ve seen so far by Keaton, but basically every gag in here is great.</p>
