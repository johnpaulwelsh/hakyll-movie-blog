        <p>Totally insane, mostly in ways I enjoyed. CGI from the early 2000s are the worst thing on this earth, so many of the fight scenes are boring because you know so little of it is real. I like the movie a lot more if I think of it as a <em>Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> episode. This especially made me enjoy the fight against the musicians more enjoyable because those guys are almost literally taken out of a <em>Jojo</em> arc.</p>
<p>Overall I have to admit I was entertained, despite the horrendous CGI and totally bizarre world-building. I’m surprised anyone gave this dude Stephen Chow the money to make this. I did like that a lot of the main cast were not young people, there’s some middle aged dudes and ladies too.</p>
<p>After seeing the movie and reading a little bit about it, I saw the name <em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em> and realized that in a lot of ways, this movie was trying to do the <em>EEAAO</em> thing almost two decades earlier. But I think <em>EEAAO</em> works better because the story it’s telling is more substantial than the tropes it’s lampooning, and also the special effects are infinitely better executed.</p>
