        <p>Unbelievably funny. Somehow they made a movie where 3 dogs and many fish die, and it’s funny every time. It’s sorta cringe humor, but you never actually feel that bad because it’s just a bit detached from reality. Like you never really feel bad about the adultery or the animal cruelty, and that’s a major achievement. It starts kinda slow but it’s all necessary, I can’t think of a single change I’d make. JLC is pretty hot.</p>
