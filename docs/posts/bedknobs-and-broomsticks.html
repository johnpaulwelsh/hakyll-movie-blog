        <p>I like this more than I probably should. I have very fond memories from my childhood of watching it, I might have seen it even more than <em>Mary Poppins</em>. The comparison between them is unfair by the way, this movie isn’t just a worse <em>Mary Poppins</em>.</p>
<p>The children are hilarious, I don’t remember them being so cheeky. The songs are catchy but some of them are admittedly a little weak.</p>
