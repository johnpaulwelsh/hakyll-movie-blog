        <p>This movie is pretty great. As soon as I saw Paddy Chayefsky in the credits I knew I was going to be in for some real emotion, and boy did I get some.</p>
<p>There are so many aspects to this movie that feel like they couldn’t have come from the 1950s. The emphasis on Catholic Italian characters, the ugly boys-club language like “dogs” and “money in the bank” that these guys throw around when cruising for girls, and maybe most of all, the perspective of Aunt Catherine. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a movie confront the issue of old ladies getting lonely. And let’s not forget the strained marriage that Tommy and Virginia obviously have, it was surprisingly vicious given the time period.</p>
<p>The movie isn’t just about Marty, and that makes it even richer than if it were just a romance from the couple’s perspective. I think the movie is all about the feeling you get when you wake up one day and realize you’ve grown up, but it tells it from a bunch of different perspectives.</p>
<p>First you have the friend group. I was kind of amazed how much of my personal feelings I could see in the later scenes with Marty kinda just hanging around his friends while they fret about stupid stuff and shuffle around aimlessly. Then you show an unhappy marriage with a husband who is obviously too attached to his mother and not enough to his wife, to demonstrate to Marty how much of a dead-end trail he’s currently on. And then there’s the mom herself, who I am SO GLAD does not remind me of my own mother. I feel like it’s a very specific combination of 1st-generation Italian immigrant, plus widow, plus middle-aged, that generates a character like Theresa. And that’s a really important pressure to put into the mix, to cause Marty to hesitate.</p>
<p>I don’t mind the abrupt ending so much, I think it’s nice to see the train moving in the right direction instead of watching the entire romance blossom over a long period of time. But I wish they had resolved the conflict with the mom more. It worries me what she’s going to do with herself if Marty does move out, because the movie did such a good job of making me believe that Aunt Katherine was right and that once the last kid moves out, a widow’s life becomes meaningless. But maybe that’s part of the point of the movie, that Marty is escaping an entire net of stuck-as-a-kid-ness, and his family is just one part of it. If the movie were longer, I wish we could see either that dynamic play out more, or else I would have settled for more scenes with Clara. She was just a really pleasant screen presence.</p>
<p>The music was kind of over-the-top at times, but that’s to be expected given the time period we’re talking about. I think if the movie were re-scored with a more subdued clarinet-based track like in a Woody Allen movie, it would feel more natural. I was impressed with the set design at times, they really didn’t mind focusing on the way dudes stand around at dance halls waiting to pick out a girl. It’s unflattering but it’s true, so I’m glad they portrayed it so frankly.</p>
<p>Side note, I hate when movies are named as just the the name of a character, it’s stupid.</p>
