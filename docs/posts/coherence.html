        <p>I really liked the premise and execution of this movie. I was afraid I was only going to like one of them. I went into it thinking it would be a kinda zany genre piece (sci-fi horror / mystery maybe), and it is that, but it also became about something else, like most good fiction does.</p>
<p>I am very glad that the story takes a turn into meaning something more than just “wow crazy stuff is happening,” because it allows the plot to get really convoluted without forcing itself to end up as a puzzle box to be solved. The drama of the story doesn’t come from not knowing which people are which and from trying to map out all the things that are overlapping, but instead from the realization that there are other realities out there demonstrating the different outcomes that come from choice. The conversation between Michael and Em is what really sold it for me. When Michael says, “what if we’re the bad versions?” that made the whole movie click in my head.</p>
<p>You could argue that the finale is a little boring because it stops messing with your head and fully locks in on Em’s perspective, and it shows her doing something that seems a little out-of-character (a ballerina planning a murder of her own self?), but it really does make sense. Em’s entire hangup is hesitation and fear of commitment - her night takes a turn for the worse as soon as Laurie’s name is mentioned, because she doesn’t trust that her boyfriend is really over his previous fling(s). He wants her to go to Vietnam, and she isn’t sure about it. So once things finally get totally out-of-hand she decides, “okay let’s find a world where my friends all make the right decisions, and most especially one where my BF is not hooking up again with Laurie,” and she finally becomes driven to make a choice, even one that’s pretty dire. I think it’s very meaningful that she resorts to lethal blows against her own self, just to take the future that she wants.</p>
<p>The acting is very naturalistic which helped sell the fact that this was a real group of friends trying to figure stuff out once it gets weird. I especially liked Nicholas Brendon because well, he’s Xander, but he’s actually not Xander in this movie, he’s actually more like Nicholas Brendon but by a different name.</p>
<p>The handheld-camera style works well for this movie because it forces you to think about perspective in a way where steady cameras might not.</p>
<p>The movie also succeeds as a brain-scramble, at least for the first hour, but the filmmakers are wise to not drive that angle too far until it becomes predictable or spends too long trying to tie up loose ends. They simultaneously let the story go off the rails, and also zoom in to bring the focus on the characters more.</p>
<p>The very last scene is a little bit of a horror-movie string, I don’t mind that. It would be equally weird to have the story end up where Em has totally gotten away with murder and the comet fixes the decoherence.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
