        <p>Honestly this movie could have been an 8/10 if the editing wasn’t so unnecessarily quick and snappy. It felt like Orson Welles was under the gun to get this movie to be under 90 minutes. So many transition scenes and establishing shots are like less than half a second in length, it’s pretty offputting.</p>
<p>I think I like this movie, but I like the different elements more than the overall whole. The idea that all of these people are horrible scumbags is a pretty established part of film noir, but here it feels a little more nasty than it would be in a movie where Bogie is a detective or some other noble but flawed leading role. It also felt like the kind of movie where there’s a Hayes-Code-obscured element of homosexuality with George, or of some kind of sexual deviance between Arthur and the woman, but actually I found it to be too subtle to land for me. The recurring line of “you’ll need a good lawyer” is pretty great.</p>
<p>That courtroom scene was the most rowdy courtroom I’ve ever seen, and that includes <em>My Cousin Vinny</em>.</p>
<p>Some of the visuals are really awesome, especially of course the mirror scene at the end, but also many of the night shots and scenes on the sailboat. I like black and white scenes that are shot at night.</p>
<p>Welles’ Irish accent is pretty bad and distracting. Not that it’s inaccurate, and maybe the movie wouldn’t be quite the same if he had an normal American accent.</p>
<p>I was surprised that all of the Chinese speakers near the end (the woman included) are left totally without subtitles. That’s something I would not have expected from the 1940s in a Hollywood movie.</p>
<p>I wonder if this is also one of those movies where the crazy ahead-of-its-time stuff that they pull is most of why it’s remembered, instead of its actual entertainment or analytical value. Like another <em>Citizen Kane</em>, only I found <em>CK</em> to be more entertaining on its own merits than this one.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
