        <p>I can’t believe how <em>fast</em> lava flows. The volcano footage is uniformly astounding of course, worth the price of admission just for the last five minutes worth of footage.</p>
<p>At first the structure of the movie felt scatter brained, but eventually it becomes clear that Herzog wants to show as wide a range as possible of the kinds of human cultures that sprout up around volcanos. A parallel is bridged between ancient Ethiopian ancestors, modern cargo cults, and the strangeness of North Korea. Some of his narration is a little on-the-nose and poetic, but it’s probably just the right amount without feeling too pretentious.</p>
<p>This also happens to be the first movie I’ve ever split watching over more than one day (not counting taking a nap or long sleep and finishing later that night, which I did with <em>The Irishman</em>). I think it would have bothered me much more if it were a fictional narrative film, rather than a documentary.</p>
