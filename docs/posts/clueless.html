        <p><em>Mean Girls</em> but more sweet. <em>Fast Times</em> but less scandalous. <em>Grease</em> but no singing and less horny. <em>Election</em> but funnier and less icky. These are all bad comparisons. I feel like this somehow isn’t the perfect teen movie, and yet it’s better than all those other ones in some ineffable way.</p>
<p>The cast is stacked, man. Everyone seems either very familiar, or else is spot-on great at their role. The music is also pretty amazing but that’s Viacom money for ya.</p>
<p>It’s a deft slight of hand to make you root for a partial-incest relationship by making the couple as cute as can be.</p>
<p>Alicia Silverstone is of course beautiful and funny and over-the-top, but also she’s great at the “serious” scenes. When she calls out Tai for going too far with an insult in her rock-bottom scene at the house near the fireplace, I really thought she was gonna cry a little and that it wasn’t an actress anymore but a real person.</p>
