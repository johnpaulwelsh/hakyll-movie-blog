        <p>Of course it isn’t amazing but it’s good, and the jokes for adults land pretty well (given that I haven’t watched this since I was a teenager probably). There are some really wild visual tricks in this movie, like showing Francis through the eyeball of a fly for about 1 second. Makes you realize just how much more effort is put into movies than into TV cartoons.</p>
