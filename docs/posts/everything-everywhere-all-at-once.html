        <p><em>The Matrix</em> walked so that <em>EEAAO</em> could run. A high concept sci-fi action film that actually makes sense. This could easily have merely been “brand new sentence, the movie” but they actually make the themes pay off in the end.</p>
<p>Some parts are so ridiculous that it threatens to undercut the sentiment, but luckily I don’t think it went off the deep end too often. The middle section has a few too many back-and-forths about what Evelyn’s final decision/strategy will be, but it is a minor annoyance.</p>
<p>The idea of stealing talents from your multiverse selves to make the crappiest you become the best you, is honestly a great idea.</p>
<p>If I liked <em>The World’s End</em> enough to give it a 10/10, then I can’t see any argument for giving this any less.</p>
<p>In a world where God does not exist and honest self-love is the worthiest goal in life, then this movie is kind of perfect. I don’t live in that world, but I can still acknowledge perfection where it exists.</p>
<p>10/10</p>
