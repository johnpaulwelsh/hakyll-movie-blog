        <p>Very funny at times, but also a little muddled. I actually think I enjoyed the movie less because I was not familiar with the actual history of Stalin’s death and the immediate aftermath. I recognized a couple names, but had no idea if any of this was accurate (turns out, it was), so when crazy stuff starts going down at the halfway point I wasn’t able to follow it as a plot, only as a series of pretty hilarious scenes of people yelling at each other. Some of the scenes are so good they could work as SNL skits or one-off short films, but the parts of the movie that actually matter don’t have quite the same bitterly wry tone, so it feels simultaneously like it isn’t long enough of a movie, and that it’s an extended joke that’s going on for too long.</p>
