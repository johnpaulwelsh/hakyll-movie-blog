        <p>I had just finished a book which took place in POW camps after WWII in North Africa. So when I saw the shanty town, I had to keep reminding myself that this movie takes place in peacetime!</p>
<p>Horrible to watch, but very educational. It’s like, you don’t expect to see something like that in color with modern clothes and buildings, because you only think of 1800s slavery or stuff from the black-and-white era.</p>
