        <p>Detective Pikachu is cute, nice, and good. It deserves its spot as the highest-rated video game movie adaptation.</p>
<p>I think it was a smart idea to make most of the important Pokémon be easily recognizable such as mascots, Generation 1, or Smash Bros. representatives. The studio clearly knew their audience would consist of a lot of veteran Pokémon fans, and the last thing any of them needed was an Gen 6 Normal-type hogging the spotlight or something. As for me, seeing Pidgeottos flying around at the beginning was actual magic and got me really hyped for the rest of the movie.</p>
<p>There were a lot of really clever moments that came from dumping Pokémon into a modern live-action world. Beatboxing Explouds being used as a sound system in the underground club made me actually laugh out loud, and the Mr. Mime scene was even more brilliant than I expected from the trailer. Using Ditto as a plot-twist kind of enemy was excellent, and the little Ditto eyes were the funniest part of the movie whether or not the creators wanted them to be. You gotta wonder though, why did that underground club have a fish tank with Magikarp in it if there’s such a high risk of him turning into Gyarados?</p>
<p>I was pretty surprised by how serious and horrifying the plot ended up being. Secret experimentation to open the door for inserting the soul of a human into a rabid Pokémon? That sounds like some serious <em>Get Out</em> shit. It worked as a pretty great mystery story too, although the twists and loose ends got tied up in a bow that was just a little too neat. I personally didn’t guess anything ahead of time so it wasn’t too lazy (looking at you <em>Incredibles 2</em>) but the twists all ended up stemming from the same parts of plot (especially the video footage) so it didn’t feel random or lazy.</p>
<p>Ryan Reynolds absolutely killed it as Pikachu, but there was some cringey acting from the younger performers, although nothing too bad. Bill Nighy worked great as a bad guy who you aren’t sure about whether he’s the bad guy until he’s <em>clearly</em> the bad guy.</p>
<p>I’m convinced Ryan Reynolds ad-libbed some of his lines or otherwise influenced the script, and you can’t convince me otherwise. Nintendo-sponsored writers would never have thrown in those innuendos and drug references, or that one climate change joke. Also, old bearded bespectacled Ryan Reynolds looks like Ben Folds.</p>
<p>If they keep making Nintendo feature-length movies like this one, then we’re in the golden age of video game adaptations, hands-down.</p>
