        <p>Some of the songs are catchy and Jason Alexander is always fun to watch, but I’m sorry this is the cheapest looking musical movie I’ve ever seen. I know it was made for TV but apparently it has a huge budget. Look at those sets, they look like they’re made of paper. Look at the visual effects for the magic dust, it’s like a Windows XP screensaver. I do appreciate that they give the prince a reason to fall in love with Cinderella at “first sight” because he had already met her and gotten to know her. Also I know that all versions of Cinderella require suspension of disbelief, but this one is utterly ridiculous. The prince didn’t at least remember the approximate age and race of the girl he danced with for 40 minutes? Why are they trying the shoe on old women and white women???</p>
