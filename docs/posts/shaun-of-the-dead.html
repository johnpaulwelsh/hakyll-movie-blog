        <p>Funny and clever, but I didn’t enjoy it to the degree that lots of other people do. The earnest scenes didn’t feel properly framed to me, like they were inartfully transitioned to and from the goofy scenes. I really think having subtitles ruined the experience for me a little, it sometimes ruined the timing of the jokes and made it feel like the characters were reading their lines on set rather than acting.</p>
<p>The “Don’t Stop Me Now” scene isn’t as funny the second time.</p>
<p>I think Wright did the same idea but much better in <em>The World’s End</em>.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
