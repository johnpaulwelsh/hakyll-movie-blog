        <p>I tried my hardest to view this through an objective lens, given that it’s the Disney movie I’ve defended the hardest throughout my life by saying it’s my favorite one. Okay so it’s not perfect. There are some lines that are clearly just badly placed jokes (“fur wedgie”), and Pain and Panic are actually pretty annoying in how wacky they are. But the songs are actually amazing, especially “Don’t Say I’m in Love” and “One Last Hope”. And the visuals are really exciting and cool, even though some scenes feel like they don’t last as long as I remember them lasting (Cerberus shows up twice for a total of maybe eight seconds but I know what he looks like perfectly in my memory).</p>
