        <p>There are two kinds of Muppet movie - plot-driven, and joke-driven. This is one of the better joke-driven movies. Like of course it will never measure up to the original <em>The Muppet Movie</em>, but I think on the merits it’s better than something like <em>The Muppets Take Manhattan</em> which is too innocouous to be memorable.</p>
<p>The cameos in this one were off the charts. I always love that celebrities want to be in Muppet productions, that warms my heart.</p>
<p>The songs were just okay in this one, nothing will ever measure up to “Life’s a Happy Song” from the previous movie. But I did enjoy “The Big House”.</p>
<p>CGI Constantine flipping around on screen like some kind of Yoda is pretty lame. Whatever happened to the mind-blowing practical effects of Kermit riding a bicycle?</p>
