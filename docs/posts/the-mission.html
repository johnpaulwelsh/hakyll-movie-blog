        <p>Kind of a slow burn. The beginning of the movie is a lot of pretty scenery and music but not a lot of it captured my emotion. But the second half is kind of incredible. I actually think I gasped when I saw the mission at San Miguel. Just think, how does a group of people in the jungle build something so huge and beautiful?</p>
<p>At some point I came to know that the movie would be a tragedy, but even intuiting that did not help lessen the blow of seeing the destruction and death and sorrow. It’s absolutely amazing that a group of people made those scenes happen, that they could orchestrate something that felt so real and harrowing.</p>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about martyrs recently, and so the final scenes gave me a sense of wonder, not disgust. I think the witness to Christ that these characters demonstrated is something we can all learn from.</p>
<p>I had a good talk with my wife about this movie after we finished watching it. She had seen it before numerous times but this time it hurt her most of all, because she understood better what was Father Gabriel holding in the final siege.</p>
<p>I’m kind of afraid to watch <em>Aguirre The Wrath of God</em> again after seeing <em>The Mission</em>. I might not be able to see one without thinking about the other.</p>
<p>Kanopy’s sound balance was atrocious, they must have locked it in as 5.1 Dolby or something and it was frustrating to listen to on a basic 2.0 stero system. I had to turn on the captions, and even that was terrible because there was a long delay between the start of the spoken line and the text showing up for that line. Man I wish I had seen this in a theater. 8/10</p>
