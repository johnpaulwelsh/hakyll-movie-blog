        <p>If I peel away all of the reputation, I like it fine, but it certainly isn’t one of my favorites. The newsreel part at the beginning goes on rather long and I found myself feeling bored by it, but in the grand scheme of things I think it’s a good way to introduce the story and the man, so maybe my boredom comes from knowing the movie a little bit already.</p>
<p>Since we learn about his life through the testimony of others, we don’t see him alone hardly ever. But once we do, at the end, it’s really stark and noticeable.</p>
<p>I like how often people’s faces are covered in shadow, it feels very modern. So does all the people talking over each other all the time.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I’m going to like it more on a rewatch. I think with some of these classic films I find less to enjoy each time I see them (see <em>Psycho</em> and <em>The Shining</em> especially). Maybe the Ebert commentary would be the best way to see this again.</p>
<p>One thing that really stuck out to me is when Kane says his first act as Governor of New York would be to appoint an AG to prosecute his political opponent. Seems very familiar to how Trump and his critics are acting today.</p>
