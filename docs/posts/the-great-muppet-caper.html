        <p>Uneven, but pleasant. Compared to <em>The Muppets Take Manhattan</em> it has even less of a real story, but overall I liked it more.</p>
<p>Some of the funniest scenes in any Muppet movie are here, including the John Cleese cameo, the newspaper office scene in the beginning, and the _____. The songs are fine, and the dance scenes and Miss Piggy dream-sequence stuff are surprisingly effortful, although they are still a little boring. Jim Hensonâ€™s obsession with overly-sentimental Kermit-Piggy content is on full display here, I would take the fluffy stuff from <em>The Muppet Movie</em> or <em>Muppet Treasure Island</em> over this any day of the week.</p>
