        <p>Holy crap that was good. Obviously it owes a large debt to <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> but even having seen that movie (and loving it), this one completely stands on its own without just being the same story with a different forest-dwelling entity.</p>
<p>Part of why this movie is so good is the long buildup, where nothing is scary at all but you learn a lot about not just Bigfoot, but also about the kind of people who live out where Bigfoot might be found. The folks singing songs were adorable, and the book store guy was so spot-on that he couldn’t have been scripted. There’s a sense that most of the folks in the town are 100% sure that Bigfoot is out there, but none of them seem to want to go out to meet one. That makes it even more freaky when Jim insists on going out there, pretty much nobody they interviewed actually encouraged doing it so you feel like they’re really venturing out into the unknown.</p>
<p>The film really becomes extraordinary once they’re in the woods, the acting and pacing is sublime. And the sound effects, oh my God. The wood knocking was kind of creepy, but I can distinctly remember my stomach dropping when they hear the wailing for the first time, it lasts just long enough where you’re sure a humanoid is making the noise, but it can’t actually <em>be</em> a human, right? That long night scene in general is so enthralling that you can easily forget you’re watching a professional motion picture, especially because it’s a one-shot.</p>
<p>The fact that Kelly is a struggling and unsatisfied actress, and that Jim proposes to her in the woods, made me momentarily afraid that this whole trip was a prank or a forceful-bonding session that Jim orchestrated with some of his weirdo friends. I would have been a little disappointed if that was how it ended, but I was really afraid it would go that way because Jim seemed that committed to his Bigfoot obsession, and that oblivious to other people’s emotional states. When they were in the tent and Kelly kept saying “turn the light off, maybe it will go away,” but then neither of them actually reached for the camera, that felt so real and made me even more afraid.</p>
<p>I like that you still don’t <em>really</em> know what happened at the end. The short little shot of what looks to be a mentally disturbed naked woman kind of confirmed my deepest fear, that there are people out in the woods, maybe in addition to Bigfoot. I guess there’s something extra scary about the thing out in the woods being intelligent like a human, but not acting like a smart human. Like if it were a bear, there would be more of a mixture of curiosity and fear, like when the thing was tapping at their tent. I actually became less afraid in that scene because I could easily imagine it being an innocent Sasquatch slowly inching toward this weird glowing screaming thing. And thinking that it’s a person messing with you isn’t that bad because eventually they’re just gonna leave you alone once they scared you right and good. But a person who is acting like an animal… that’s terrifying. You don’t know what’s gonna happen next.</p>
<p>All I know is, I’m now deathly afraid of going camping.</p>
<p>Does a found-footage horror movie need to do anything else other than be plausible and be scary? I don’t really think so. This movie is a perfection of the form so it deserves a 10.</p>
<p>10/10</p>
