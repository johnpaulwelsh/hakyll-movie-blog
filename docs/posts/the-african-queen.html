        <p>I liked it! Seeing Bogey in color was kind of shocking, especially because he starts out with a scruffy beard. It makes him look like an uneducated blue collar guy, not one of the biggest movie stars ever.</p>
<p>It seems ridiculous to hatch a scheme to blow up the German ship without much of a plan for getting rescued afterwards. But maybe I missed the details about how they thought they would get out of there.</p>
<p>Seeing Rosie pour out all the whiskey immediately made me think, “Why is the rum gone?”</p>
<p>There’s nothing about the movie that elevates it beyond good old fashioned entertainment, but that’s okay.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
