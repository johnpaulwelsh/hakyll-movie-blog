        <p>Marion’s story at the beginning is kind of boring. Once she gets to the motel the movie noticeably becomes more invested in its own story.</p>
<p>Anthony Perkins gives an amazing performance. Everything he says and all his physical mannerisms seem taken out of a different universe, he comes across with the honesty of a bit-part in a noir film but he ends up carrying the entire film.</p>
<p>The movie isn’t scary in the least for an adult audience who already knows what’s going to happen, and at this point who doesn’t know what’s going to happen in <em>Psycho</em>? The creepiest part of the movie is Norman’s calm disposal of Marion’s body, and the fact that you hear the mother’s voice multiple times. I had forgotten how much of the movie tries to convince you that Norman’s mother is really still alive, since it’s common knowledge now that Norman himself is the Psycho.</p>
<p>The explanation of Norman’s condition at the end is kind of heavy-handed, I think they could have cut half the lines and gotten across the general point, but while maintaining some level of mystery and intrigue about it.</p>
<p>The music is classic, of course.</p>
