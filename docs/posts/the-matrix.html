        <p>The first half is well-deserving of its “instant classic” status. Wonderful imagery, compelling dialogue, and good pacing.</p>
<p>The second half kind of just becomes an okay-level sci-fi action movie, and the philosophical stuff stops being super interesting and starts making way for more conventional plot stuff.</p>
<p>I haven’t even seen any of the sequels yet, but I think one of the biggest problems with this movie is that it requires sequels, and it’s inevitable that the sequels won’t do the story justice. The stakes are raised so high, and the “Neo is the One” stuff is so strongly emphasized, that there was no way they could shoot that ending and not lead it up with at least one more movie. It honestly feels like the movie is all a pilot episode to a serial adventure TV show, which if you think of it that way, it would explain why so much of the movie is dedicated to either exposition or flashy action sequences.</p>
<p>Overall I think <em>The Matrix</em> is very good at being cool, but only kinda good at being smart.</p>
<p>I think there are two ways the sequels could go - more good action but less story, or more bad action and more bad story. I think I’d prefer the latter, in the same way that the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels are good because they’re ambitious but flawed. I’d rather have an ending that doesn’t make sense and doesn’t fully satisfy, rather than more typical cool-guy action and a big final fight that results in a normal victory.</p>
