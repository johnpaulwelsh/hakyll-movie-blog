        <p>It’s good. Not “best thriller of the 2000s”good, but certainly a solid normie movie for grownups. The end confrontation is just as good as it ought to be. I liked the music and the scenes of driving at night.</p>
<p>The scene when Michael and Arthur are arguing with the baguettes looks totally fake. The focus on the background was off or something.</p>
<p>I still don’t understand how Arthur got his hands on memo #229.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
