        <p>Before the movie: most relaxing menu music on a DVD ever.</p>
<p>After finishing the movie: oh no, actually the saddest menu music ever!</p>
<p>I love this film. How do I count the ways?</p>
<p>The beginning is so compact at telling you what’s going on and who the characters are. It’s very nearly hard to follow, but just clear enough. Great editing.</p>
<p>It’s so effective at making me feel the way the protagonist feels. The first half I’m becoming smitten with the woman, with a lingering suspicion that she’s not telling the truth, then at the midpoint turn I feel betrayed, then when she shows up again I slowly realize that she’s pursuing him like a lovesick puppy. It feels futile to even outline it like that though. This movie is just really good at telling a story with complicated emotions.</p>
<p>I really like how this movie shows us what’s happening on phones. It doesn’t feel too hokey. I’m just glad to see a detective story set in modern times so that they can’t make it easy for themselves by having no digital devices around.</p>
<p>10/10</p>
