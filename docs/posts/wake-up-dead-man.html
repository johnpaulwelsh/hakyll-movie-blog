        <p>The acting feels a little off sometimes. Like the way Kerry Washington delivers the line containing the movie’s only <em>fuck</em> is very strange and does not seem like the obviously best take for that scene.The beginning is quite slow, the plot involves a lot of explaining, and the whodunit it not too hard to figure out. And there aren’t a lot of laughs, not nearly as many as <em>Glass Onion</em> had.</p>
<p>BUT. Everything else is fantastic top-of-his-game stuff for Rian Johnson. And this movie gets major major points from me for being the most healthy and timely portrayal of Catholicism that I’ve ever seen (move over Scorsese). The idea of “religion as winning” is a poison in American conservative thought right now, and the only answer is to put your fists down and open an embrace, like the priest does in this movie. The scene where he talks to the receptionist is the heart of the film and anyone who doesn’t understand its significance needs some prayers sent their way.</p>
<p>Also invoking <em>The Hollow Man</em> is directly meant to appeal to me so the mystery element of the movie was also quite exciting and satisfying. I wonder if there’s a reference to all five of those book club novels: <em>The Hollow Man</em> is directly mentioned of course, but also I think the false twist in the middle (the priest writes down the story and his omission of time spent alone conceals his complicity in the crime) is supposed to remind us of <em>The Murder of Roger Aykroyd</em> which was also on the list.</p>
<p>Blanc’s actions at the end can seem a little hokey and anticlimactic, but this is one in a long tradition of the detective giving up his final gotcha speech out of mercy for the culprit. Poirot does it all the dang time.</p>
