        <p>Firstly I was on the verge of falling asleep the whole time, but honestly I don’t know if I would have liked it more if I were more alert. There’s a dreaminess to this movie, a lack of structure and floaty attitude to it, which makes it seem right to watch at night when you’re already tired.</p>
<p>There’s not much focus on character or personality, and it’s not really concerned with following one person through the whole story, which is why they keep killing off the “main character” every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I guess the movie is meant to show the absurdity of wartime imprisonment, and the lengths men will go to to save their own skin, out of desperation. Every character seems to either lie about what crimes he has committed, or else rat out someone else even if he has to lie about the crimes they committed.</p>
<p>As the movie went along it started to feel more like a wartime drama from the era of the American Civil War, and less like an artsy fartsy European movie. I bet if I watched it again I would see that latter tone more present in the earlier scenes.</p>
<p>Everything above makes it sound like I liked it. Maybe I did? But I can’t make heads or tails of it at the same time. Let’s say it’s a 6/10 now, and 7/10 if I learn more about what the intention behind the film was.</p>
<p>I still don’t know why those three dudes jumped off the roof after they whipped the naked girl to death.</p>
<p>The ending was kind of great though, the <em>in absentia</em> pardon of the rebel leader but the condemnation of everybody else. It really drove home the sense of cruel meaninglessness of it all.</p>
<p>The wide open spaces and floaty camerawork is really impressive and feels very modern. I guess the mid 1960s isn’t so long ago, but given that I’m used to stuffy European movies in B&amp;W, it felt novel for this one to look so much like an American Western at times, and to also have such a fluid camera motion. There’s also a part later in the movie where the sky gets darker and lighter due to clouds overhead, and it really impressed me, even though I can’t help but think, “man that director got lucky” instead of “what a skilled move that was.”</p>
<p>6/10</p>
