        <p>Psychological thriller my foot, this is a comedy. I would be shocked if Ari Aster hadn’t watched this before writing <em>Beau is Afraid</em>.</p>
<p>It starts out slow, and for a while I thought there wasn’t enough happening and that the comedic tone was not fully committed to. But over time the film really won me over. It makes you realize how unnatural and hostile the idea of a city apartment is, it’s simultaneously isolating and forcibly communal.</p>
<p>Did this movie come out after Roman Polanski got charged with child sexual assault? If so then this could definitely be an angry “they’re trying to get me” self-pitying metaphor. But I don’t care, this movie is great.</p>
<p>Stella’s actress is very pretty, she plays well the only seemingly trustworthy character.</p>
<p>I like that they watch <em>Enter the Dragon</em> at the movie theater.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
