        <p>I really wish my watching experience was more conducive to being immersed, I was holding my sleeping infant daughter and constantly adjusting the volume, even pausing once or twice.</p>
<p>It’s like Argento thought, let’s do Sudpirua but focus even more on awesome set pieces. This is a very cool movie, even though there are some very cornball moments. Like I said before, Argrnto somehow gets a pass because I find his movies so slick and cool.</p>
<p>The underwater scene at the beginning is amazing. The colors are stunning, almost comically so. And the music isn’t quite as iconic as in Suspiria or Deep Red, but it’s really in your face in a way I like a lot. Reminds me of Phenomena, where a needle drop of Iron Maiden actually plays as cool and not stupid.</p>
<p>I find it interesting how much water plays a role. Rain at the beginning, the underwater scene, the drowning of the cats, a bath, etc.</p>
<p>I could buy the theory that Argento went too far up his ass on this one and felt the need to go back to basics with Tenebrae. No idea. If that’s the going theory, but I’m inclined to see some truth in it anyway.</p>
