        <p>An extremely frustrating experience. Mostly feels like a bad joke, with occasional shimmers of brilliance.</p>
<p>I don’t care about how much direct quoting of the Gospel is used here, because it often feels amateurish and crude. The Beatitudes, parables, and other sayings of Jesus are done in the least artful way possible, a bunch of isolated close-ups or wide shots with hardly any breathing room between them, often delivered as fast shouting. There’s no drama to it. Its almost like Pasolini read the Gospel and decided to shoot it in the least creative way he could think of, to maximize the cringe factor. If you’re going to have so much of the movie consist of long monologues by Jesus, at least give us an indication that the crowd is digesting what he’s saying or something. You know what it is? It feels like a bad school pageant combined with a political rally.</p>
<p>Other than Mary and Jesus, the adult actors are almost exclusively just mugging stupidly for the camera or staring into the distance with no emotion on their faces. It’s like the worst tendencies of European filmmaking. Ironically this doesn’t happen with the children in the movie, they’re allowed to act more naturalistically, when normally it’s the children in older European films who stare blankly at things.</p>
<p>The editing is actually atrocious, half the time the musical score just stops abruptly on scene transitions as if this were a student film and the creators hadn’t learned how to fade out yet. It seriously felt like I was watching a test print of the movie.</p>
<p>The crucifixion and resurrection are particularly embarrassing. The way Jesus yells on the cross, followed by the camera shaking and a building toppling, just feels totally off given the stakes of what’s happening. And when the stone is blown off the tomb to show its empty, it feels like it’s played for laughs, and everything after it feels rushed and lazy. Angel speaking, crowd walking, Jesus talking, the end. How is anyone supposed to think this is good filmmaking?</p>
<p>What was good about this film then? I think it’s genius to show the Sanhedrin and Pilate scenes from the crowd’s point of view almost exclusively. And every time we see children I couldn’t help but smile because they all look so happy and innocent. And I generally like the score, especially using a mix of classical and Negro spiritual styles.</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve felt so negativity toward a beloved movie that I doubted whether I watched the same thing as everyone else did.</p>
<p>I keep seeing mention of this movie as having Marxist themes, but I don’t understand what is meant by this. I hate throwing labels around without explanation.</p>
