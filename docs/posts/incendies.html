        <p>A 7/10 movie, brought up to 8 by the tender and excellent ending. If there’s a lesson of the film, it’s that war destroys families, but families can be restored. For a while I was skeptical that I’d appreciate the film by the end, because the violence and tragedy I was watching felt truthful but kind of pointless. And especially when I figured out that the father was the brother, I thought I’d be mad at the film for being a vehicle for sad depictions of war and a brutal twist, but without much else to say. Somehow though, the dialogue and acting elevates the finale into something hopeful, or at least not mean, which was the way some of the earlier scenes felt.</p>
<p>In terms of content this is one of the most upsetting movies I’ve seen in a while. Certainly since I became a father I haven’t been disturbed to the degree this one disturbed me. It’s probably because they showed the birth and removal of all the children, and also showed at least two kids being shot.</p>
<p>I feel stupid for thinking it, but is the war-torn country in this movie real or invented? I googled Daresh and only got results for this film, and they seem to never actually mention the name of the country. Or maybe I’m just a stupid American who doesn’t know 20th century history in the middle east. Christians vs Muslims in the 1900s doesn’t sound familiar, but what do I know? EDIT: okay yeah it’s not a real country, but it’s based on Jordan which is a nation I know nothing about.</p>
<p>I bet this movie is so extremely high on Letterboxd and IMDb because it’s watched by a lot of teenagers and early-twenty-somethings, so there’s a “whoa” factor involved here. The same reason Tarantino gets slightly elevated scores from what the films really deserve (does <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> really deserve to be number 70 on the IMDb list?).</p>
<p>8/10</p>
