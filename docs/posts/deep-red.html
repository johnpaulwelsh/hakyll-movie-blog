        <p>This movie rules. It wastes no time before the camera starts going bonkers and the set design just pops off the screen in a marvelous way. This movie has a really excellent blend of great little side-scenes or single shots mixed in to the important story scenes, to the point that it feels like everything is instantly memorable.</p>
<p>The acting is superb, especially Marc’s and Giana’s. Marc has such an expressive face, every scene that has even a slightly comedic tone becomes hilarious with him involved. Special shout-out to the arm-wrestling scene.</p>
<p>The music is awesome, even when it fades out abruptly or feels totally inappropriate for the scene. I actually like that the music lowers the scare factor by making scenes feel more like music videos.</p>
<p>I feel bad for anyone who would get distracted by the terrible lip sync on most characters, they’re missing out on a wonderful thriller movie. If <em>Suspiria</em> ends up improving itself in my mind when I get around to a rewatch, then Dario Argento will become one of my favorite new discoveries.</p>

<p>After seeing the longer version, I can understand why a lot of the scenes were cut, the American cut is so much punchier and cuts to the chase more. But I didn’t mind the cut-out scenes, in fact all scenes with Marc and Gianna are amazing and I wish they all remained in the English language version. It was really frustrating to see this in English and Italian flipping back and forth. The subtitles are translating the Italian words, not copying the English I’m hearing, but the subtitles need to be on for the Italian scenes for you to know what they’re saying. So for the whole movie I’m bouncing up and down from faces to words, and half the time the words aren’t an exact match to the voices!</p>
<p>As soon as Marc has his epiphany in the plaza that Carlo couldn’t have killed the psychic, I got chills, even though this was my third viewing. Chills for the whole rest of the movie too. It’s a perfect five minutes of cinema.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
