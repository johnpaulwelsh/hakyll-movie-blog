        <p>Idk, this one was pretty dumb. Too many scenes of traveling and drunken singing. It was goofy, but I wasn’t sure if it was trying to be (the climax of the movie convinced me that yes, it is a little goofy on purpose). At least it was short.</p>
<p>I liked the music, the camerawork, and the makeup for the young witch, and the wackiness of the final night in the church was pretty good. But otherwise nothing really did it for me.</p>
<p>After watching it, I read somebody who put it into the same category as <em>The Evil Dead</em>, and I could begin to see the movie in a different light, maybe as a knowingly-silly exercise in on-screen nonsense and histrionics. But I also saw multiple places refer to it as “genuinely frightening,” and that just doesn’t fit at all with the movie I saw, so who knows what I think anymore.</p>
