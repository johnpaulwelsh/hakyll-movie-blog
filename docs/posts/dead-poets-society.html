        <p>Underwhelming. It’s nice, and the boys are likeable enough, and Robin Williams is good in his role. But the focus on “carpe diem” poetry seems kind of artificial (they really only read self-empowerment poems? Really?). And I don’t really buy that the class as shown would be so transformative to all of these kids. I still don’t really get why Charlie brings those chicks to the club that one night. I think I’d appreciate Keating more if there were more scenes where he’s one-on-one with the boys. It also seems to linger a really long while on Neil’s death and the scenes after, in a way that I find clumsy instead of somber. But overall it’s more good than bad - sensitive boys connecting with their teacher is a good story no matter if it’s excellent or merely adequate.</p>
