        <p>Did not win me over as believing that this is one of the best action movies of all time, but it’s certainly good and has tons of style. The “buddy cop but they’re both sexy” angle is always good.</p>
<p>The fact that the patients get shot is pretty messed up, man. But the babies make it out okay! Thank goodness.</p>
<p>The music is absolutely excellent. And the way the camera moves during the action scenes is very satisfying.</p>
<p>I am in love with the aesthetics of that hallway, it feels very <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>
<p>Some of the storytelling is a little sloppy. You can’t say your protagonist is a jazz-loving alcoholic if he’s only shown playing jazz once, hangs out at a jazz bar when nobody is there, and never is seen drinking except in the first few shots.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
