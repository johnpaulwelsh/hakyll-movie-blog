        <p>I don’t know what was going on, but I also don’t care. That was the coolest vibe ever. Now I think sometimes people use “vibe” as a dismissing term or a concession, like “oh it’s not good enough to have substance, so at least it succeeds in giving off a vibe.” I think that would be an unfair way to use the word here. <em>Interface</em> is an amazing aesthetic achievement and I don’t think it’s a criticism to say that most of the imagery and plot developments are there to set a mood, to evoke a feeling, to give off a vibe.</p>
<p>Take <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>End of Evangelion</em> and give up on trying to make the story make sense, and you get <em>Interface</em>. Maybe it’s more like, remove the ego and self-importance of both of those stories and that leads you to what <em>Interface</em> gets right.</p>
<p>Mishchief is really funny, I love him.</p>
<p>The music… honestly some of the best stuff I’ve heard in a movie in a long time.</p>
<p>The visuals and pacing are clearly influenced by anime, and maybe even specifically by anime openings and FMVs. There’s very much a music-video quality to some of the second half of the film.</p>
