        <p>I am really conflicted about this movie. I really like the visuals and music, and I was really into the story for about the first hour. Lots of freaky stuff happens and the reason that the violence is breaking out is kept very secretive. But once the mysterious stuff stops, and the true nature of the story comess to light, I like it a lot less.</p>
<p>Since everybody’s motivations are hidden for so long, I can’t help but think that the story is kind of allegorical, something about colonialism since there’s ultimately an armed conflict between white gunmen and “natives.” but then there’s the question of the footage of Pacote going around shooting people, and the motivations of Lunga. Why are they the good guys? What’s going on in near-future Brazil that warrants the armed warfare between villagers and city folk?</p>
<p>The blatant caricature of the mercenaries as gun-crazy American racists (mostly) leaves me feeling cold for some reason, even though nothing about the characters feels representative of me or the country I love. It’s like how I imagine Germans feel about seeing Nazis depicted as bloodthirsty assholes, they agree with the depiction in principle, but it still feels icky because it’s a foreigner’s depiction of their lived history, so there’s not much nuance.</p>
<p>One theme that I think rings true, even though I didn’t like it’s inclusion overall, is the idea of modernity vs. traditionalism. The towns people of Bacurau are traditional even though they have modern gadgets and cars and stuff. Whereas the mercenaries are all loner freaks with no sense of community, even though they “use vintage weapons.”</p>
<p>I wonder what the point is of setting this in the near future, other than allowing for the translation gadget that the mercenaries use.</p>
