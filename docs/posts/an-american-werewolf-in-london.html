        <p>What a fantastic movie. Really funny, but also a proper werewolf horror movie. The personalities of David and his friend are great to watch, both before and after the friend becomes a walking corpse. It also manages to squeeze in a pretty satisfying “sexy nurse” fantasy, because Alex is one hot chick. David running around naked at the zoo is a personal favorite scene of mine. The ending is pretty much perfect because of how blunt and no-nonsense it is. It takes kind of a long time to get to “David is a werewolf” scenes, but the pacing makes more sense when taking the movie as a whole after it’s finished.</p>
<p>The song choices of only songs with “moon” in the title is almost lame, but ends up working. The Princess Diana congratulations in the credits is pretty weird too.</p>
<p>They use literally the same makeup style as in <em>Fright Night</em>, and maybe even <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>. But I’m sure it was innovative at the time.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
