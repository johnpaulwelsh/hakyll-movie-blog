        <p>I am not a pro with Italian horror movies, but so far in my journey into those kinds of movies, this one was the most extreme and most frustrating one.</p>
<p>The story makes no sense at all. Many of the supernatural events are given no context among the rest of the scenes of the movie. And the rationale and behavior of some of the characters seems really poorly put-together. No satisfying explanation is given for what the white-eyes means, or why the red-haired girl adopts it from Emily after the funeral and in the autopsy theater. Maybe she is a host for the spirit of Emily? But then how does that explain the house that Eliza visits to talk to Emily, turning into a run-down abandoned shack when the doctor visits?</p>
<p>The gore is often so over-the-top that I was either covering my eyes (because it’s gross) or laughing (because it looks so stupid). The spiders are a perfect example of both in the same scene - the live spiders are creepy and I did not want to look at them, but the fake spiders biting into the dude’s face looks so ridiculous that even though it’s also really nasty, it has an amusement factor as well.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of clumsiness with the minute-to-minute storytelling. As one example: when the doctor gets a gun and starts shooting at the zombie patients, it’s clear that the only effective shot is through the head, and yet he constantly hits them in the abdomen or arms before landing a bullet in the head. And it’s also proven early on that he’s an amazingly good shot, because he’s able to plug the guy grabbing Eliza into the arm and head with barely half a foot of room to avoid hitting her in the face.</p>
<p>All that being said, there are definitely good parts to the movie.</p>
<p>The jump scares are really quite good, even though jump scares in general are a pretty cheap tactic.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is also really nice, there are a lot of good scenes that use darkness or shadows to make things creepy. The music is also great, although the prog-rock track(s) reminded me too much of Dario Argento’s films. Maybe that’s par for the course for horror films from this era, but it feels like a cheap copycat kind of thing.</p>
<p>Most of the horror elements were gory nonsense, but some of it was enjoyable gory nonsense. Especially anything pertaining to the character Joe, like how he gets his eyeball popped out in the beginning, and he pops out of a bathtub near the end and makes another eyeball-related kill.</p>
<p>Also there’s something endearing about how much the movie gives off the vibe of, “the director is an Italian making a movie about the US but he is cutting a lot of corners.” There’s a sign in the hospital that says “Do Not Entry.” The lip sync is often pretty bad, even for actors who don’t look Italian in heritage, which implies that even they are faking their line deliveries and don’t speak English well.</p>
<p>The ending scene is pretty outstanding. Reconstructing that creepy painting as a real location in the film is one of the legacies of this movie, I am convinced.</p>
<p>The way I see it, if you’re going to make a horror movie with the barest level of storytelling just as an excuse to get to the scares, you should make me want to actually see what’s scary. But the extended shots of spiders crawling and gross boiling faces and ripped flesh just aren’t up my alley very much.</p>
