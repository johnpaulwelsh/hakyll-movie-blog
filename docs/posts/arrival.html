        <p>I like it exactly the same amount as when I first saw it in 2017. The family parts are definitely more moving this time around now that I’m a dad. I was less irritated and stressed out by the idiot military guys who keep second-guessing queen Amy Adams. It’s amazing how much handwaving there is with how she learns how to read their language. There are lots of scenes which (at least streaming on Paramount Plus) look hella like it’s plastered with visual effects, like any time someone is in a hazmat suit or when Louise’s hair is flowing in the smoke.</p>
