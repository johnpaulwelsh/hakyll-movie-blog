        <p>Still holds up after all these watches. Seen in a theater, it’s clear that this movie was made on the cheap in a dirty and smelly and wet environment. The killer rabbit was the part that made me laugh the hardest this time around, other than “Build a bridge out of her!”</p>
<p>Sitting in that theater after the screen turns black and the intermission music plays for five minutes, it made me realize that the final joke is really played on the audience. Arthur and his knights are the victim of all the abuse, but in the end, so are we.</p>
<p>It’s amazing that every single scene is a classic a memorable thing in the public consiousness. The average episode of <em>Flying Circus</em> is not nearly as consistent as this movie is.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
