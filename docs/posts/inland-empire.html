        <p>This was my third time watching <em>Inland Empire</em> but the first time I’ve seen it (or any David Lynch movie) in a theater setting. It was amazing. The sound system really let you hear all the creepy rumblings that are scattered throughout the movie.</p>
<p>It’s pretty strange that we see the entire film through a consumer-grade digital camera, but there are many scenes from the movie-within-the-movie that are presented as if they are real events (until they break character when the scene ends). And there’s even a moment where it’s fully obvious that the movie they are shooting, <em>On High and Blue Tomorrows</em>, is shot on old-school film. It feels very much like a behind-the-scenes footage reel sometimes, where there’s some nicer-looking film version coming along but for now we get whatever the documentary crew captured at the time.</p>
<p>There are definitely times where it feels like Lynch was too excited about the freedom that comes from a handheld camera, and we spend a lot of time looking up people’s noses. There are also a lot of transitional scenes that go for “spooky and surreal” by simply pointing a bright light at Laura Dern’s face and having her look concerned directly into the camera.</p>
<p>This time much more than on previous viewings, I was paying attention to the scenes in Poland and making connections. So here’s a brief summary of what I think is happening in this film:</p>
<p>A cabal of foreign men are in possession of a movie script that’s cursed. They use it to lure actresses into working on films that adapt the script, only to then get sucked into an alternate dimension where they are forced into a prostitution ring. It happened at least once before in Poland with Emily Stofle’s character. She’s watching on the TV everything that’s happening to Nikki Grace, knowing that she’s going to get sucked into it too as the next victim, which is partially why she’s crying throughout the whole movie.</p>
<p>The cursed film sucks you in by blurring the line between reality and ficton - the story is about an illicit love affair, and it supernaturally leads the lead actors to actually have an affair. This is why Nikki’s husband doesn’t interrupt Nikki and Devon when they’re having sex - he’s playing a part too, trying to lead them in the right direction so that Nikki gets trapped. When the husband confronts Devon at the dinner scene, he’s playing a part there too, he’s not actually violently jealous.</p>
<p>Devon’s jealous wife might be part of the system as well - she directly leads to Nikki’s character dying in the film, which is presumably the point where Nikki is supposed to get sucked in permanently. But maybe something went wrong because Nikki delivers such an excellent performance of dying, that she seems to break the spell. Then she ventures into the netherworld, shoots the Polish guy who’s involved in the prostitution ring, and succeeds in freeing Emily Stofle’s character from the in-between-world hotel.</p>
<p>David Lynch pulls a lot of tricks in this movie which simultaneously give the audience something to “figure out” while also being very obtuse about the overall meaning of certain things. When the woman with the screwdriver in her side is juxtaposed with the jealous wife later in the movie, the natural audience reaction is “a-ha!” followed by “wait, do I actually understand anything better now that I know that?” Lynch knows that stringing along an audience for three hours without any intellectual payoff would be too punishing, so he works in these little discoveries and resolutions to make it seem like you’re learning. It also makes repeated viewings very rewarding, because you can look past the little “gimmes” to see the broader connections that you probably missed the first time.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that he manages to make the final 30 minutes so moving and haunting pretty much justifies everything that happens in the preceding 150 minutes. And then as a reward, you get the most bonkers credits-sequence of his (or anyone’s) career. It feels like such a bookend to a body of work, that I almost feel like it would be better if he never released another feature film, because how do you cap off your career any better than with that dance party sequence?</p>
