        <p>Somehow the movie strings you along to feel the rush of the gamble, even as you are watching from a birds-eye view and can tell that every decision Howard makes is a worse one than the previous one.</p>
<p>Halfway through I felt that the only way I could feel resolved was if Howard were to die at the end, because there is no way he could dig himself out of his hole. But then he DOES end up lucking out on his big gamble, and he STILL DIES. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so shocked into a stupor by the ending of a movie.</p>
<p>I wonder if there was a theme of white exploitation of blacks running through the movie (the miners in Ethiopia, Howard betting on KG).</p>
<p>The music was evocative and pretty aggressive. I guess I should check out Oneotrix Point Never.</p>
<p>Julia Fox was wonderful to watch because you couldn’t tell if she was being a bad actor, or her character was just doing a lazy stripper-girl act, or whether her character was just <em>like that</em> and she was playing it straight.</p>
<p>There are so many excellent scenes and moments that I can’t name them all. All I can say is, this movie was really good. But boy was it stressful. It makes me love my current job and my wonderful wife. I’m so glad that my life isn’t like Howard’s.</p>
