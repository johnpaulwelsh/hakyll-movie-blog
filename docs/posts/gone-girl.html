        <p>It’s a perfect movie, and a work of great technical and storytelling genius. I almost don’t know what to say because I think the themes are so clear and so well-explored, that I couldn’t possibly add to them.</p>
<p>Even before the big middle twist, I suspected that the wife had set up her own disappearance due to frustration with the marriage, but boy did I not catch on how deep the rabbit-hole went.</p>
<p>I paused the movie to pee right after Nick and Margot looked in the shed, I was actually shocked that it was only halfway through! It really pulled a <em>Minority Report</em>, where you think the movie is wrapping up and the big trick is revealed, but then a much more important story unfolds.</p>
<p>The movie makes you feel like an accomplice, not in the crimes, but in the celebrity true-crime obsession. I actually leant forward when Nick was facing the camera on the interview show and about to speak directly to his wife, wherever she might be. And gosh darnit, Amy did the same thing immediately after! I got played, son.</p>
<p>I felt the movie trying to make me turn on Nick and believe that he was completely in the wrong. And I fought that instinct, not because I believed Amy instead, but because I knew deep down that that was part of the game, and I didn’t want to play. Then when Amy’s reveal came along I felt the movie trying to make her detestable, but I didn’t want to go along with that either. Because it’s all a game. The media presence so early in the film is the real stroke of genius, and that’s really what the movie is about. It’s about spinning a narrative, and how making yourself the center of attention in the United States is a very real career move, open to only the most cutthroat and heartless people. And the public just eats it up.</p>
<p>Watching Amy piece together the second half of her plan is amazing. You can see the gears turning and it’s really edge-of-your-seat stuff, especially once Desi comes into the picture.</p>
<p>I love Carrie Coon and I wish she were my sister.</p>
<p>I can’t believe they showed Ben Affleck’s dong.</p>
<p>I think I read this somewhere else first, but it’s true: Ben Affleck is the best casting for this role because he always looks like a total meathead idiot who’s being strung along by somebody smarter than him. Even before you realize that’s what’s happening, he looks like that! He just looks too pathetic to have made his wife disappear.</p>
<p>There are little scenes or shots that I wonder why Fincher did them that way. Like really early on when Nick is in the police station for the first time, there’s a very brief cut to outside the room looking in after he makes the stupid joke about the <em>Law &amp; Order</em> theme song, then it cuts right back in. I wonder about things like that.</p>
