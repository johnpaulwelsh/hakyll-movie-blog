        <p><em>It Chapter Two</em> is all about memories and character. The first movie can stand on its own as a not-that-scary horror movie with good character interactions, but the second one hinges entirely on whether you formed an emotional connection with the Losers. On that front I think this movie is a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Every time one of the characters went to a new location as part of their totem quest in the big meaty middle section of the movie, I felt a twinge of memory and a little flashback of what I remember happening at that place when I read the book. It was almost like I momentarily thought they were my own memories, or at least something more than having seen that part of the movie set during the first movie. Downtown Derry looks exactly like it looks in my imagination.</p>
<p>Because the movie is so long, I was really hoping that all the juicy details would be kept from the book, and for the most part I was right. I especially liked the beginning up to the Chinese restaurant scene, where we are getting introduced to everyone as an adult - there are a bunch of little details that could easily have been cut but just help fill out the characters a little more, like Beverly being in an abusive marriage or Eddie having married a woman who is just as fat as his mom was. The gay bashing makes a little less sense in 2016 than it would have in 1986, but at least they don’t have MAGA hats on.</p>
<p>I’d like to pour one out for the Turtle though. The teases were good, and I understand it would have just been stupid to include him in the movie, but it still would have been nice. Maybe a deleted scene? I’m hoping. Also Henry Bowers got done so bad, he deserves much more than an escape scene and two attacks with sharp objects before he kicks the bucket.</p>
<p>The ending is significantly different but I’d say it was for the better. Smushing spider eggs is just not as exciting of an ending in movie form. I just wish that it didn’t seem so much like a trick, like, “Why didn’t I see it before? We can just do this!” And I think the lead-up has one or two more ideas than was necessary, with all the scares that each character has to confront (Ben being buried alive, the three doors for Ritchie and Eddie, Beverly stuck in the bloody bathroom stall, Bill shooting his younger self).</p>
<p>All of which is to say, if you don’t have an existing connection to the characters because you had read the book before, or if you are expecting all the characters to be interchangeable or generic, you might think 90% of this movie is boring or pointless, or both. It doesn’t surprise me that the critical reception seems to be a lot more mixed than the first one. If you didn’t feel like the kid Losers were your friends too in <em>It Chapter One</em>, then the adult Losers might seem awkwardly verbose and overly detailed in <em>It Chapter Two</em>. For those of us in the know though, it’s clear that the screenwriter knew what he was doing with the source material.</p>
