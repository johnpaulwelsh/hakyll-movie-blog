        <p>What a stupid movie. Probably the most lurid and deranged set of characters I’ve ever watched, but it’s all in service to a confusing and dumb story which adds insult to injury. I totally forgot who the floppy hair man was after he first showed up, so by the time he’s revealed as an accomplice, I didn’t understand his relationship to the wife. I’d say at least 60% of this movie is just there to set up another sex scene (which got laughable after the 3rd or 4th one - you’re telling me Florianna slept with her uncle and her aunt and the local milk man, and she wasn’t a killer?), then another 20% for murder scenes (which are fine I guess, especially when Giovanna falls down the stairs), and the rest was either evil cat scenes or storyline filler.</p>
<p>I refuse to believe that this movie would hold up on a rewatch. The wife being one of the killers just doesn’t seem to hold up continuity-wise with scenes where someone attacks her from off-screen, or squaring it all with the bookstore killer.</p>
<p>I think I’m all giallo’d out for a while. In hindsight I don’t know why I gave <em>Death Laid an Egg</em> a 6, but this a 3. The former was so hard to watch due to the style that maybe I was more intrigued than annoyed? Whereas for this movie I just got bored after the halfway mark and only looked forward to more cat scenes (I liked how unabashedly evil he is) and more disrobed Edwige Fenech scenes (she’s got quite a body).</p>
