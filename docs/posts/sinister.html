        <p>This one scared me, a lot. The pacing is magnificent, where as the movie goes along the nighttime scenes get longer and more agonizing, and the daytime scenes become shorter and less comforting. And could these be the best jump scares I’ve seen in a while? Probably yes.</p>
<p>The lighting and the music are probably the two most impressive elements of the movie. When a scene is dark, it’s realistically dark. Even when a scene is during broad daylight, Ellison is often depicted in total shadow/profile. Every dark corner of a room is scary when you do the lighting this well. And the music was really quite varied and unsettling in different kinds of ways, especially when each home movie seemed to have its own theme song. Apparently there was even a track by Sun O))) + Boris in it, according to the end credits!</p>
<p>Part of me can’t help but think, “this is a better adaptation of <strong>The Shining</strong> than the movie <em>The Shining</em> is.” Mostly a joke.</p>
<p>Maybe the weakest part of the movie is the way it ends, not because it isn’t scary (it is), but because it becomes kind of typical. If the movie started out with a really great balance of “this stuff is actually threatening” and “this stuff is a metaphor for obsession,” then by the end it’s obviously thrown out the latter and gone completely with the former. It follows the logic of the movie, but that’s all it does, so it feels like kind of an uncreative ending.</p>
<p>I also really like how much time is dedicated to showing Ellison using his early-2010s Mac operating system to edit and view old Super-8 film. It was kind of nostalgic but also refreshingly realistic, no crappy “zoom, enhance” tricks, just pure user experience.</p>
<p>Still, I was mighty impressed with this movie. It’s much better than a typical haunted-house flick.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
