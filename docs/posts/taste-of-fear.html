        <p>It’s really good! Very creepy, I was actually kind of scared during some of the scenes in the first half when the corpse shows up. It’s got some good twists, which aren’t the hardest things to guess at but still put a smile on my face when they are revealed. Susan Strasburg is very beautiful, she reminds me of Donna from <em>Twin Peaks</em> when she wears her sunglasses.</p>
