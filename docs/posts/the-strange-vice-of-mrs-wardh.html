        <p>Pretty terrible, even worse than <em>Your Vice is a Locked Room</em> because the twists feel like a sloppy afterthought. Sometimes you see an ending like this and it makes you want to watch it again to see how it all fits together (like <em>Perfume of the Lady in Black</em>). But with this movie I actually feel the opposite, it would be less fun to see it again because it would either still not make sense, or it would fit together but reinforce the feeling that the first watch was a waste of time.</p>
<p>It’s not even a good excuse to see Edwige Fenech naked. <em>Your Vice</em> is less boring than this one is.</p>
<p>The Wardh marriage might be the least substantial marriage in the history of movies, it might as well not even be there.</p>
<p>Julie faints an awful lot.</p>
<p>The “romance” buildup between Julie and George is totally half baked to the point of being a joke. He’s unbelievably pushy, but a motorcycle ride and “I’m afraid of the black car” is enough to sleep with him? At least in <em>Your Vice</em> she’s a proactive sex fiend whereas here she’s very passive.</p>
<p>Okay but it’s a giallo so the plot hardly matters. Is it cool at least? The answer is mostly no. There are some okay shots and music cues but mostly there’s just a lot of nothing happening. The ice cube on the door lock trick is pretty cool.</p>
