        <p>Talk about a grower. This starts out like a less compelling version of <em>Wild Strawberries</em>, and ends up almost as absurd and likeable as <em>Smiles on a Summer Night</em>. I think the unevenness of the tone works against the movie a bit, but overall I found myself enjoying it quite a bit by the end. Especially when I think of the last 15 minutes compared to the first 15 minutes, they feel like completely different movies in a not-so-good way.</p>
<p>For a while, the alternating flashback-current scenes reminded me of <em>Dancer in the Dark</em>, in the sense that the flashbacks become more and more happy while the current-day scenes become more and more depressing. But then sometime on the train to Copenhagen that dynamic stopped, and everything became goofy and “comedic” in the classical sense.</p>
<p>I’m starting to think that “characters speaking frankly about their views on the world, humanity, love, etc.” is going to be very hit-or-miss with me. Sometimes it works and sometimes it’s annoying, and often it alternates within the same film. Maybe later Bergman is more straight-drama and features more plausible character traits. But I guess I will find out next time, when I watch the TV version of <em>Scenes from a Marriage</em>.</p>
