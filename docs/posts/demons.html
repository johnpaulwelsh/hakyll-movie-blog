        <p>okay so that was one of the coolest probably maybe the coolest movie watching experience it really helps to have just the really loud propulsive live band playing with the music the now for the movie the movie was awesome like so for the first like 30 minutes you were sitting there in a theater with a balcony watching people in a theater with the balcony watch a horror movie and you know that that’s a really interesting effect like it couldn’t have lasted a whole time obviously and of course the baby stops playing at some point but it was just really cool and like occasionally freaky to be in such a mirror image situation as the characters were I like that the cast is so would ridiculously varied like and with no explanation at all why is a pin there with two of his hooves why is why did a man bring his wife on their anniversary to see this movie obviously he doesn’t give a shit but like there’s they just gather a bunch of random people and then make them sit there watching this other horror movie which is itself bad but like in a very tropey kind of way like it’s like I would watch that on its own if it was a full-length thing but then just the it’s very simple like they’re not trying to do something like complicated here and I really liked like the kind of main characters especially George like become superhero by the end but there’s no cheesy 80s transition into that like there’s no like I’m gonna rip the sleeves off my shirt and now I’m a tough guy and I’m gonna put a band-aid up a bandana on my head like Rambo or whatever it’s it just like happens like George just becomes cool and wheeled to Katana and it’s great then you know then as far as the movie watching experience like the sound quality of the regular movie was like a little bit in and out but definitely not enough to bother me because like this is definitely the kind of movie where it doesn’t matter what they’re saying like it could have been in Italian dubbed and I would with no subtitles and I wouldn’t mind it because it’s all about the music the visuals the vibes and just it’s just so funny like there’s a lot of funny parts of the movie and it’s not just because the audience was laughing a lot because the audience is just a fan of glory nonsense so they clap every time it happens like oh man they went crazy when that helicopter crashed through the ceiling just because it was so out of the blue yeah I don’t know like maybe I think in the first 30 minutes you can make some kind of argument that the movie is like on it on an on an artistic level getting at something by by having the you watch a movie where people are watching a movie right like it’s what they say that to them is about or what seemingly every movie within a movie gets is like this veneer of we’re saying something really important and interesting because you’re watching them and all this stuff I don’t know if it’s like you know thesis statement or anything but I did find a cool especially like when the one hooker goes behind the screen and is trying to break through it and it’s just it was just cool it was just cool to see someone go back there like they this movie was not it really went deep into the we’re in a movie theater angle it they go up into the projection booth and it’s this particular machine and they go behind the theater and the screen and they go into the bathrooms and they go into the atrium and the storage rooms underneath it’s just it’s just really like detail oriented and I loved it and of course the music made it even better like I probably would want to see it again but I would insist on having the volume really loud because hearing that music kick in when a zombie jumps up over onto the balcony it’s just like that’s what makes it for me</p>
