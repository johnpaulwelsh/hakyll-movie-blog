        <p>Okay, so that was one of the coolest, probably maybe the coolest, movie-watching experience. It really helps to have just the really loud propulsive live band playing with the music.</p>
<p>The movie was awesome. For the first 30 minutes you were sitting there in a theater with a balcony watching people in a theater with the balcony watch a horror movie, and you know that that’s a really interesting effect. Like it couldn’t have lasted a whole time obviously, and of course the movie stops playing at some point, but it was just really cool and occasionally freaky to be in such a mirror image situation as the characters were.</p>
<p>I like that the cast is so ridiculously varied and with no explanation at all. Why is a pimp there with two of his whores? Why did a man bring his wife on their anniversary to see this movie? Obviously he doesn’t give a crap. They just gather a bunch of random people and then make them sit there watching this other horror movie, which is itself bad but in a very tropey kind of way, I mean, I would watch that on its own if it was a full-length thing. It’s very simple, they’re not trying to do something complicated here. And I really liked that the main characters, especially George, become superheroes by the end, but there’s no cheesy ’80s transition into that. There’s no like, “I’m gonna rip the sleeves off my shirt and now I’m a tough guy, and I’m gonna put a bandana on my head like Rambo” or whatever. It just happens, like George just becomes cool and wields a katana. And it’s great.</p>
<p>As far as the movie-watching experience itself, the sound quality of the regular movie was a little bit in-and-out, but definitely not enough to bother me. This is definitely the kind of movie where it doesn’t matter what they’re saying, it could have been in Italian dubbed and with no subtitles and I wouldn’t mind it because it’s all about the music, the visuals, the vibes. And it’s just so funny, like there are a lot of funny parts of the movie, and it’s not just because the audience was laughing a lot, because the audience is just a fan of gory nonsense so they clap every time it happens. Oh man they went crazy when that helicopter crashed through the ceiling just because it was so out of the blue.</p>
<p>I think in the first 30 minutes you can make some kind of argument that the movie is, on an artistic level, getting at something by having you watch a movie where people are watching a movie. What seemingly every movie-within-a-movie gets is this veneer of, we’re saying something really important and interesting because you’re watching them.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s a thesis statement or anything, but I did find a cool especially when the one hooker goes behind the screen and is trying to break through it, and it was just cool to see someone go back there. This movie really went deep into the “we’re in a movie theater” angle, they go up into the projection booth and it’s this particular machine, and they go behind the theater and the screen, and they go into the bathrooms, and they go into the atrium, and the storage rooms underneath. It’s just really detail-oriented and I loved it.</p>
<p>Of course the music made it even better. I probably would want to see it again but I would insist on having the volume really loud, because hearing that music kick in when a zombie jumps up over onto the balcony… it’s just like, that’s what makes it for me.</p>
