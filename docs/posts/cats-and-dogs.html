        <p>Dumb of course, but not that annoying. I missed some scenes because I had to run an errand. The CGI is really really bad at the beginning (especially whenever the dogs’ eyes go big) but gets more tolerable as it goes. Miles better than <em>Scooby Doo</em> and probably on half the budget. There’s something about the charming lawn play with the boy and the dog that feels like a perfect kids movie from the 90s or 00s.</p>
