        <p>I thought this was going to be really boring, but I was glad to discover it isn’t. The story is basically nonexistent of course, but I’ve come to discover that these older Disney movies are not at all about the story, and all about the vibes and the antics. For a movie about cats, there’s a lot of goofy dog action with those dogs in the country, and I love that stuff. It reminds me a lot of the chase scenes in <em>Robin Hood</em>.</p>
