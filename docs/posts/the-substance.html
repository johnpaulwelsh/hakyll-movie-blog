        <p>This is not a subtle movie. It’s not a movie where there are that many surprises, except in the sense of “oh, they actually went that far.” Every bad thing that could happen, does happen. Every instruction for The Substance is abused. So in that sense it’s also one of the most satisfying movies out there - anything you can imagine that would make it a better movie, I don’t think they skipped on it. It’s all there, for you to see (and enjoy???). It commits to the bit so hard.</p>
<p>I think the black humor is absolutely critical for this movie to work. If it were a depressing tragedy like <em>The Fly</em> then it would just become unwatchable near the end. But moments like when Elizabeth is making gross French cuisine while yelling at the TV, is a welcome burst of comedy.</p>
<p>In one sense this reminds me a lot of <em>Meet the Feebles</em>, because it ends with a blood-soaked hippo beast covered in blood on a stage in front of an unsuspecting audience. It also reminds me of the end of <em>Braindead</em> because… look at the <em>blood</em>!</p>
<p>At first I didn’t like that there was a little girl in the audience at the end. But much like the whole rest of the movie, it’s important for the message that you actually see all of it. Imagining what could happen isn’t enough, you need to participate as a spectator. So you can’t just get away with thinking that it’s just shallow adult men and women who are complicit in the culture that causes this kind of story to happen. The impact it has on little girls’ conception of self-image is part of it, maybe one of the most important parts of it. So as much as it upset me to see her screaming and crying and covered in blood, I am glad the filmmakers were brave enough to put it in there.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s a brilliant move to keep the audience totally absent from the movie until the very end. You never see anybody watching these shows except Elizabeth herself. You never see the studio audiences either.</p>
<p>I never want to see skin again on my TV, I’ve seen enough. Also the casting of Margaret Qualley is perfect because she is just so sexy. She might be the best coy lip-biter in the history of women.</p>
