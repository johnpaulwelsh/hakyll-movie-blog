        <p>Cute, but kind of slow and samey. The character of Buster isnâ€™t really there here, his motivation is harder to read. But the ladder gag is a great stunt and some of the antics with the horse are funny, though most of it is kind of dull (what is with the medicine he gives the horse that makes it jittery?).</p>
