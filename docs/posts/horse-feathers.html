        <p>Really funny. I wish I had more to say but that’s all, I laughed a lot.</p>
<p>I’m surprised I didn’t get sick of hearing the same song performed four times.</p>
<p>It’s fun to see football being played 90 years ago and seeing that it’s basically the same game.</p>
<p>My wife was uncomfortable with all the groping and kissing that the women in the movie needed to endure, and she’s got a point.</p>
<p>There were some really awkward cuts during the scene where Chico performs on the piano, while everybody is running around. [EDIT: turns out that’s an artifact of lost footage, it can’t look any other way at this time in history.]</p>
