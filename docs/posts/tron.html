        <p>I really enjoyed watching this, but a lot of it comes from “so bad it’s good” territory. I guess this is how many people feel when watching <em>Labyrinth</em> (not me, I think that movie is actually great).</p>
<p>To be honest, the story is nearly incoherent. It’s almost like they cut out 20 minutes of exposition and left in 20 minutes of psychedelic nonsense and cool transition scenes. There are so many little concepts and visuals that show up once and disappear just as quickly. Like the little green bug guys, they are so cute! Probably the most Disney thing in the whole movie. Or the fact that the programs who are imprisoned are accused of having a religious superstition in believing in the supremacy of The User.</p>
<p>There are so many questionable decisions, below is a brief list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does stealing the code for video games make this dude a millionaire and the executive vp of the whole company?</li>
<li>What does Encom do?</li>
<li>Why are all these brilliant young people working for The Man?</li>
<li>The light bikes have almost nothing to do with the movie? I thought that was what the game <em>Tron</em> was all about.</li>
<li>Why the hell is the movie named <em>Tron</em> if Flynn, the star of the movie, didn’t write the program by that name? It’s almost like the mixup people make between Zelda and Link in <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games.</li>
<li>Why would the program form of the girl recognize the program forms of Alan and Flynn?</li>
<li>When Tron sends an I/O message to his user, we never see anything in the real world corresponding to what happened. So did Alan knowingly respond to Tron by typing an answer into the computer?</li>
<li>To the humans other than Flynn even know there’s a cyber-world that Flynn traveled to?</li>
</ul>
<p>But even after all of that, I’ve never seen anything like this before and I cannot believe that it was made in 1982. The visuals are actually stunning and I could not get over how otherworldly it looks, or comprehend how they actually pulled it off on a technical level.</p>
<p>In all, Tron is a really unique look into the techno-fantasy imagination of the early-80s. Almost none of the visual metaphors for technical concepts (especially the “hacking”) make any sense at all, but it’s always interesting to see what non-techies thought things could be like in the early days of personal computing.</p>
<p>I prefer this to <em>The Matrix</em> for some reason. Maybe because <em>The Matrix</em> starts out as philosophical high-concept sci-fi, but by the midpoint of the first movie and all throughout the rest, the really interesting stuff is mostly just the goofy action. Whereas the world-building in <em>Tron</em> is so flimsy that you don’t feel bad for missing out on a great story, so you can just marvel at the ridiculous sights and sounds on screen.</p>
