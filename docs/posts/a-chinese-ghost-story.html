        <p>Ah so this is the kind of movie being referred to in <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em>!</p>
<p>It’s so ridiculously entertaining. The camera movements and special effects are some of the most exciting things I’ve watched in a while. There’s so much energy in every second of this movie that it makes me mad that American action movies are so static and lifeless in comparison. This has a lot of <em>Evil Dead II</em> vibes, too. The zombies, the tongue, and the flying heads at the very end are my favorite effects.</p>
<p>If I had to find negatives, most of them stem from the absolutely terrible subtitles I watched with. Also the ending is really rushed, they could have afforded maybe two more minutes of bringing the story to a conclusion after the girl moves on. But that’s hardly worth complaining about.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
