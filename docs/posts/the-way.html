        <p>A nice movie. Not too emotionally complex, but not too stereotypical either. The acting was good, the landscapes were beautiful, and the inclusion of Catholic elements was tasteful. The music selections were questionable sometimes, especially the lone synthpop cut from what sounds like Alanis Morissette among the acoustic folk-rock stuff. And only one song in Spanish? Câ€™mon guys.</p>
