        <p>This is maybe the most balanced giallo I’ve seen, except maybe <em>The Cat o’ Nine Tails</em>. There’s a good mystery with lots of suspects which get ruled out one by one, there’s a nice amount of sexy content, and it’s really funny, especially the detectives and Marilyn. I like a lot of the camera movement, it’s often handheld and swings around to look at things from weird angles, like sitting on a table when Jennifer is chopping vegetables or cranking up to the sky when Marilyn looks for the intruder early in the film. It’s interesting that the killer’s motive is “revenge” against sexually liberated Italians for making his daughter impure, when the film itself seems to be made my folks who are at least very comfortable with sexual liberation, if not believers in it. You don’t cast Edwige Fenech unless you appreciate perfect breasts and intend to show them often.</p>
