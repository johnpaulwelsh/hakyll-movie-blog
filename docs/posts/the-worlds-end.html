        <p>Just a grand old time. Few movies pull a plot 180 as well as this one does. Maybe overall the slow realization in <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> is more thematically rich, but you can’t beat the sudden bathroom brawl in <em>The World’s End</em> for sheer WTF-ery. The fight scenes in this movie are really interesting too, it seems like the camera is doing tricks to make the fights look more impactful and cool, but I can’t place what those tricks actually are. It’s all very dynamic and slick.</p>
