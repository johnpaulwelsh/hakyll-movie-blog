        <p>It’s been my favorite movie since maybe 2010, but this is only the second time I’ve watched it with somebody else, and probably the fifth time watching overall. The excitement has died down significantly after so many watches, but there are still some parts which really get to me. The floating camera in Winkies, the investigation of Diane’s apartment, the Club Silencio scene of course, and most of the post-blue-box scenes. I am now of the opinion that the plot and themes of the movie are 100% obvious and not hard to follow at all, but of course it’s unfair to compare me in my early 30s watching it for the nth time against me in my late teens watching it for the first time. The sex scene in the bed is less explicit than I remember, and the topless scene after the blue-box transition is more surprising / out of the blue than I remember. I also remember the sound of Rita’s heels in the beginning of the movie being very clacky and ugly and loud, but on this watch it was more tolerable. Maybe because I’m watching on a good set of speakers for the first time.</p>
