        <p>I liked it, but the ending falls a little flat for me. Part of it is that I got confused for a few minutes when Krzysztof brings Kinga to the site of the car crash. I thought he was saying that she had really died, and the this woman was just a random amnesiac who they were pretending was his wife. But in the following scenes it’s clear that she’s really the wife, so that was just me being dumb or tired. I think the meaning of the ending is, that the family has all actually moved on past her “death” so she doesn’t really need to stick around, and she realizes that. It’s kind of a misanthropic ending in that way.</p>
<p>I really like how we see Kinga from behind for a lot of the early scenes, and we get more and more closeups as she becomes more acclimated to living in the house.</p>
<p>My favorite element of this movie is the slow progression of Kinga getting more comfortable. The fact that she gives Krzysztof a blowjob before hugging or kissing him is meaningful because she’s trying to get intimacy, but still at a distance. And the scene where they kiss and finally make love is awesome, the acting performaces of their initial hesitation and eventual passion is really naturalistic and believable.</p>
<p>The scene on the beach is amazing too, the tension that comes from Kinga thinking that she lost her husband and son again is really palpable.</p>
<p>The location scout did a great job, the beach and woods locations are really evocative and memorable, especially the crazy wind sweeping across the sand.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
