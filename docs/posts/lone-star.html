        <p>Just as good as I remember it. Simultaneously a scattered and anecdotal character study, and a unified and cohesive reflection on culture clash, history, and injustice. Heck, even the incest reveal at the end is a poetic representation of Texas as a place: a mixed-up American and Mexican plot of land with a history that doesn’t need to be an obstacle for progress and love. Okay maybe that’s a bit of a stretch, but gosh darn it this is my website.</p>
<p>I particularly liked the blending shots between the past and present this time around, because it doesn’t happen every time so each occurrence feels fresh.</p>
<p>I was really surprised to see Frances MacDormand show up in the credits, but even more surprised to see who she shows up as.</p>
