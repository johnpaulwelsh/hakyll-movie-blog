        <p>What the heck, this is funny! Why does Tubi show the genres as including horror? I think the eye slicing reputation precedes the film too much, it’s shocking but not played as horrifying, and honestly it’s not even close to the most interesting thing here.</p>
<p>Watching other silent films recently helped me a lot to appreciate the place this has in history, I think. Imagining someone leaving a theatre after watching Buster Keaton and then entering another that showed this, is mind blowing.</p>
<p>I think the “props” in general here are interesting only insofar as they feel totally out of place in a silent film from the 20s, which of course is the point. The eye, the ants on the hands, the donkeys on the pianos, and the severed heads are entertaining on their own because of how weirdly morbid they are.</p>
<p>But I think the real greatness here is the playing around with reality and time and images. The transition from the woman’s armpit to a sea urchin is hilarious, but the return of the armpit hair (when it appears on the previously-mouthless man in place of his mouth) had me actually laughing out loud. I also love the sequence when the man is groping the woman, and his imagination of her breasts changes to a butt instead (which honesty looks like a man’s butt actually).</p>
<p>I love the violent encounter between the man and himself, where one moves in slow motion almost like someone from the Black Lodge. I actually wondered a bit at how they shot the double-role scenes, it’s pretty impressive camera trickery.</p>
<p>The title cards are also pretty funny because they often show up right when you want an explanation, but they provide no such thing.</p>
<p>The music I watched it with played a major role in my emotional reaction to the film. There are basically two tracks, jaunty accordion and somber orchestral. The eye slicing and most of the nun and girl scenes are played with the accordion, which made me see the humor in those scenes that I think was always there.</p>
<p>Is it lolxdrandom? Yes, kinda, especially when putting two scenes together and trying to figure out what the connection could possibly be. But I choose to think of it as a pretty great film prank, in which case the randomness is less high-art surrealist and more low-brow humorous.</p>
