        <p>A classic. It’s obvious that the story began as a play, but also it has enough of that Hitchcockian flair where it works as a film just as well.</p>
<p>Is Grace Kelly considered a good actor, or just an iconic beauty?</p>
<p>I swear that the first time I watched this it was black and white, but apparently that couldn’t be the case. The colors looked so good once the movie got going that I forgot all about it anyway.</p>
