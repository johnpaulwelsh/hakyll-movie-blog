        <p>Honestly, this movie is pretty stupid. The story itself starts out good but ends up a bit unsatisfactory. The lingering element of mystery tickles the right part of your brain well enough. But the way the movie is shot, reconstructed, and organized is like, the definition of “manipulative”. The long shots of people looking mournfully into the camera are the worst, that’s just bullcrap and makes me not wanna trust anything the filmmakers are telling me as a documentarian. As the movie went on, I felt more and more annoyed at the interview scenes with the imposter, and I especially started disliking the re-enactment scenes. It all felt very cheap.</p>
<p>If I were forced to play devil’s advocate on this strategy of filmmaking, I would argue that the phony made-for-TV anesthetic of the film is a meta-commentary on the story that’s being told. Just like Nicholas’s family was taken in by this imposter who brazenly made up so many details about his life, the movie plays everything up to be as dramatic as possible, until you become suspicious of everything all at once. And then they throw in a nothing conclusion to rub it in your face.</p>
<p>But I don’t really believe that. I think it’s just a hacky movie about a surprising series of events, but that also seem less dramatic than they really were because the film is trying to really twist the knife every second of the way.</p>
<p>The worst part is the spot near the end where they throw in the “twist” that maybe the family killed Nicholas. It makes you really want the film to conclude that that’s actually what happened. In one way it’s better that it doesn’t work out that way, because that would be horrible as an actual story. But it’s just tacky to spin that angle so strongly, especially with the guy with the shovel at the end. Give me a break.</p>
