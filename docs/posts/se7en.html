        <p>A perfect movie, with a perfect script and perfect execution. It feels weird saying that I enjoyed this because it’s so punishing and has such a bleak ending, but how else can I articulate how well-done I think it is?</p>
<p>The world is so grungy and horrible, and I like the scenes that explore the world. The apartments are all wet and drippy and the paint is peeling off, the lights are either too bright or not bright enough, and it’s always frikkin raining. I think the only nice building in the whole movie is the library.</p>
<p>Lots of good foreshadowing about Tracy getting beheaded, like how she shows up in the window of the kitchen while she’s cooking (she’s in a box!)</p>
<p>The car ride at the end is so tense and so interesting and so well-acted, and I totally forgot that it happened so I was on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p>Some goofy parts - he would never have been able to get an insanity plea because he demonstrated that he knew that society thought that his crimes were crimes. And hearing the cops talk about the list of books that John Doe checked out (Thomas Aqua-something, Dante, The Bard’s Tale, etc.) was pretty cringey since I know more than the average person does about those authors and books.</p>
