        <p>I liked it! The themes of truth vs. story felt really sincere, and the affect of alcohol in the Native American community jives well with other things I’ve heard of. It feels very early-90s rather than late-90s, especially the outfits. I found all of the characters really charming. My favorite scene of all might be when Arnold is retelling the basketball game, it really leans in to the “probably a fantasy, but isn’t it better that way?” kind of angle.</p>
<p>I think the resolution and closure comes on a little abruptly, and without much tieback to the themes that got introduced earlier. Also they spend an awful lot of time making “Indians do this” jokes which comes across as very much accomodating an audience who is unfamiliar with Native Americans completely. Imagine a movie with Black Amwricans where every sarcastic comment is something about their history of being enslaved or something about coming over in boats. Wait actually, I think I’ve seen that a lot in movies with Black characters… But I’d like to imagine those movies were made by goofy white people who have a very basic sense of what makes Blank people funny.</p>
<p>I really hope <em>Rain Man</em> isn’t too similar to this when I eventually watch it, because otherwise I will be disappointed by the similarity. Or else, I’ll be disappointed that Thomas didn’t refer to it in a meta-joke, since he seems to be the movie guy.</p>
