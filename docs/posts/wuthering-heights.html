        <p>I am usually pretty good at giving an older movie the benefit of the doubt with regard to the emotional range and techniques that were common at the time. But here is where I draw a line, because I think this movie kinda stinks. The worst part of it is, I could see a great tragedy novel underneath, and I bet if I read the book I would like it a great deal, but this movie is so lacking in nuance that I am compelled to believe the script is at fault, not the original source material (and not even the actors or director, honestly).</p>
<p>For the first half of the movie especially, Cathy is so self-contradictory that I was desperate to find a thematic underpinning for her behavior. The best I could come up with is this: Cathy is worldly in the Christian sense, and so she’s doomed. She even admits as much, when she relates her dream about entering heaven and not liking it up there, and wanting to come back to Earth. That also explains her discontent with both earthly lifestyles that she’s offered, being the stableboy’s girl or living a luxurious and glamorous life as a gentleman’s wife.</p>
<p>I think Heathcliffe is a much more convincing character, but I think that’s mainly due to Lawrence Olivier’s acting abilities. When he looks longingly or angrily at somebody, I actually kind of believed it. His motivation to fold in on himself and do underhanded and nasty things to get his way is fairly understandable, which doesn’t make it any less tragic to watch.</p>
<p>But man oh man, did this movie fail to get across believable characters! If you’re going to have somebody have a love-hate relationship with somebody, the worst way to convey that is to make them yell at the person out of hate, and then turn around and embrace them out of love, and do that a couple times across the duration of the movie. It’s just so immature and underdeveloped. It feels like this movie took all the story beats of the book and just told them as straightforwardly as possible, but skipped all of the book-ish stuff that usually lets you actually get invested in the characters. Don’t just tell me that after Heathcliffe marries Isabella, their household becomes hopeless and dark. Show it to me! I don’t mind the story dragging along if it makes me care more as a result.</p>
<p>I might also just be unimpressed in general by stories about British masters of houses and ladies at dances, and the intrigue that comes from choosing what kind of life you want to live when all the options seem unrealistic or stuffy and boring. I had to put down the book <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> at about the halfway point when I realized that I just didn’t give a crap about what happened. For <em>Wuthering Heights</em> it was a similar situation.</p>
<p>Cathy talks too fast when she is angry, it really feels like bad acting no matter what decade you’re in.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that none of the adult characters have any children, the story represents adults stuck in their own obsessions and fighting for power that is only of this world. Heathcliffe probably wouldn’t have cared as much about buying Wuthering Heights if there were any heirs in the picture.</p>
<p>I think the kid actors did a great job, honestly.</p>
