Hard to believe this really exists. Even from the beginning it's strange, like it doesn't only get weird or silly or self-aware when they get to the castle. I mean, it begins with a glitzy glam-rock cover of the 20th Century Fox theme.

There are ups and downs of course. The series of songs in the lab gets a little overwhelming and chaotic, especially the transition into "Hot Patootie."

But the songs are undeniable, like have you heard "Sweet Transvestite?" Or "I'm Going Home?" When it gets to Frank singing "Whatever happened to Fay Wray?" I am pretty much sold on this being a major milestone in Western entertainment.

Tim Curry is a maniac and I can't look away from his face.

9/10
