<h2>Welcome to my movie review blog!</h2>

<img src="/images/movie-clip-art-movie-clip-art-20.gif" style="float: right; margin: 10px; height: 50%; width: 50%;" />

<p>This mostly will be a spot where I put short (maybe medium-length) reviews of all the movies I see, in roughly the order I see them. I might also sprinkle in some longer articles centering on some broader film-related thoughts.</p>

<p>These will not be fully qualified reviews so posts will make the most sense if you have seen the movie. Also, <b>spoiler warnings</b> apply to pretty much all posts.</p>

<p>I have an account on <a href="https://www.icheckmovies.com">icheckmovies.com</a>, where you can find the running list of every movie I have watched. I originally kept this in an Excel/Google Sheets document, but decided that was too cumbersome so I migrated that data to a profile on this site. <a href="https://www.icheckmovies.com/profiles/wearing2raincoats/">Click here to see my profile!</a></p>
