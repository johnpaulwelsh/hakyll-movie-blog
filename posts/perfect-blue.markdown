Okay, I just saw _Perfect Blue_. I'm really glad I saw it in a theater and it was like, a perfect setting. I was a good distance away from the screen. The sound was loud but not too blown-out like it was with the first _Fate/Stay Night_ movie and probably the second one if I remember correctly. One of the problems that can come from watching anime mostly on a computer screen or a TV is that when you go to see an anime movie, it feels like too long of an anime episode. But seeing something in the theater can really avoid that problem because it's a different setting that sort of makes you respect the medium more and think of it as a movie, instead of something that should have been told in 30 minutes but decided to stretch longer for no reason.

_Perfect Blue_ is a good-to-great movie about the creepiness that can come from fame plus the internet. It's pretty cool to see a story that was told in 1997 or 1998 that feels so modern. I mean of course there were computers, computer-related stalking cases and even storylines... Like I'm pretty sure there's an episode of _The X-Files_ from maybe '96 that had to do with online dating and/or celebrity stalking, can't remember. But it feels more like a topic that would be told in 2005, but it's being told with really hilariously old computers in this one.

Also, I need to get out of the way that so much of what the movie's going for is also gone for in _Inland Empire_. Now I wanted to be careful and not accuse one of influencing or being influenced by the other, because I have pretty high confidence that David Lynch has never watched any anime, or if he has it was like, not as research for ideas. The only time he's ever mentioned that he's seen anything that was recent was like, something from the '90s I think. So I'm not saying - and I don't really want to think in terms of - _Perfect Blue_ is just _Inland Empire_ but less wacky. There is a little bit of that.

I think it's a mistake, obviously, as a mature watcher of something, to try to outsmart the story, where you think that the story's only there so that you can outsmart it. There was a time in my life where I would have watched _Perfect Blue_ and basically all of the thinking that I would spend afterward would be, which scenes reflected reality, which scenes reflected the TV show, and essentially figure out which time she was getting confused versus things were actually happening that appear to be confusing. I think that obviously the movie is not trying to just make that as a point, so it's more respectful to take every scene for what it is, which is a demonstration of what it can feel like when fame and digital media and your own self-perception can overlap and start to blur. Also I think that it's slightly a commentary on dark, moody, bloody, sexy thriller stories. You know, there's one guy who says something like, "Why do all Japanese thrillers have to turn out that way?" At first I thought that was kind of a funny self-dig. But I think that that's actually one of the main things the story's trying to go for. During the rape scene especially, you as the viewer are not yet primed to think every scene that's dramatic could be in the show or could be real life. Like, it seems pretty clear that the script is calling for a rape at the strip club, so that's what's happening, but since they need to pause and shift around the cameras, it lingers for long enough for you in the audience to get pretty uncomfortable, more than you think you would be, given that you're told ahead of time that this is not real. And I don't think there's any reason to read into this being like, an element of the hallucination. She was upset by the experience, it's foolish to think otherwise. And so I think that that's trying to say something true about the constant push for our beautiful actors and actresses to keep doing and being involved in such dark gross things. The audience of that show "Double-Bind" is not going to see the rape scene in as much of a length of time as we did watching it, or even the cast did making it.

I like that the movie tries to present a resolution that's not just, you know, she goes and commits suicide. This movie did not do what Lynch does in _Inland Empire_ which is to have one of the most amazing forgetting-that-you're-watching-a-movie moments, when that camera zooms out after she passes out and dies. It would be a little bit too hokey if it kept going going that way, that would be what I would consider a mid-level _Perfect Blue_ impersonator movie or TV show which would do something like that. Where it's just that it's leaning too much into getting the audience to be as confused as possible and that's the fun of it.


I's interesting to think, what does it say about the main character that her that her mentor/manager/agent was going around committing murders on her behalf and writing the diary entries pretending to be the idol form of her? I don't think it would be fun to watch it again and try to spot all the different sort of opportunities that the agent would have had to cause things to happen. Like, when she was known to be in her apartment when some crazy stuff happens. In the apartment obviously she sets up the computer and sends her to Mimi's Room, and she must have already been writing the diary. Which really just indicates, I don't think any of that would be all that deep except for the fact that the agent is an ex-idol. There seems to be some anxiety from her parents that she's stopping being an idol and starting being an actress, but isn't it funny that
supposedly the motive of the murderer is keep up this fake version of a person because it's the one you're comfortable with and obsessed with and that's where you think success is. Meanwhile what that person's actually doing instead is acting, which is the most voting thing that she could have moved to. It's just trading one artifice for another. That's why I think that the movie is trying to say something about stardom and fame and sort of putting yourself out there for an audience, but trying to keep part of yourself called venting at the same time.

I did not feel sleepy or forget what I was watching, which is very common for sleek moody anime, especially in movie form. Miyazaki, I've never really felt too narcoleptic by, but oh my gosh _Ghost in the Shell 2_ is like the exact opposite of end of the spectrum of trying to achieve what they're going for, compared to _Perfect Blue_. _Perfect Blue_ is taking this concept of psychological problem thriller and _GitS 2_ just leans in to weird animation so we can just be as salient as we want.

I've started to be less and less impressed with animated movies over time. I think it's kind of silly to think of them as a genre because genre is about more than what it looks like. You can have an animated drama or an animated comedy, there's no reason to lump those two together because that might prompt people to think that there's something that they need to have allegiance to. There's no reason for someone who's a fan of anime comedies to like anime drama, but if you keep grief and thanks only as far as genre and then medium, then you get people who have go in with wrong expectations. I do sometimes think - and I did in this one - what is valuable about this story being animated instead of live action? I think I'm less impressed with the visual aspect of animated movies over time because there's a pressure to make things perfect, for lack of a better term. But you can make anything you want in an animated movie. I'm not going to go raving about a camera angle because there's no real camera. I'm not going to be raving about a color palette because like, you see in _JoJo Part 4_ you can make a color palette whatever.

I think that this is better as an animated movie partially because it's about idols and and Japanese dramas, so it's like another layer for the viewer to think about. If they're they're used to seeing, or at least for me, you know... I'm familiar mostly about idol pop singers through anime, so maybe I like it more than the average Japanese movie goer in 1998 would have liked. Or I like it less, and it may maybe they are very into the real-life counterpoint angle instead of seeing another layer on top their eyes due to the tropes of anime. But I think that if you were to make this movie again shot-for-shot but in English with English actors, it would be just as bad as the
_Death Note_ remake. _Death Note_ didn't even get the story right, but even if you got the story right for _Perfect Blue_ it just wouldn't work because it would just look too goofy. You would need to do so much more camera trickery to cover up the psychological weirdo details, so in the final fight scene where it's switching back and forth between the idol version of the woman and agent version, and there's still a little bit of confusion as to how exactly everything's happening, because she's obviously not jumping down like a fairy on top of the lightposts, but there does appear to be an actual fight in an alleyway. So the question then is, how do you make that look good in a live-action movie? You'd have a lot of darkness, you'd have a lot of screen transitions, and maybe even some terrible CGI, and it would just defeat the purpose. There's such a freedom in animation to let something happen without making the viewer think too hard about how it's happening, and maybe that is a strain of animation compared to live action, is that you can kind of get away with whatever you want, and therefore you can let a lot of things that would be in-your-face in live-action can become sort of background noise or just tropes of the medium.

I think again overall, good movie, possibly great, certainly in the realm of movies that are tracing the struggles of an actress trying to keep her insanity. Like, I've seen worse, I've seen better. But it's not fair to think of _Perfect Blue_ as just that kind of story that I'd rather see told in _Mulholland Drive_ or _Inland Empire_. It's saying something unique, especially about the early computer realm, or at least anxieties about the upcoming computer realm, because there's just a lot tied in to reading an online diary, an online diary is inherently creepy because there's really no reason to believe that the person writing it is who they say they are. I think that's why people were supposedly so mad when lonelygirl15 was outed as an actress. I would definitely say that this movie is prescient for the lonelygirl15 phenomenon and blogs.

8/10
