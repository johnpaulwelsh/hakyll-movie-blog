Okay, I just saw perfect blue. I'm really glad I saw it in a theater and it was
like a perfect setting. I was a good distance away from the screen. The sound was
loud but not too blown out like it was with the first Fates Day Night movie and
probably the second one if I remember correctly. And one of the problems that
can come from watching anime mostly on a computer screen or a TV is that when
you go to see an anime movie it feels like too long of an anime episode but
seeing something in the theater can really avoid that problem because it's
like a different setting that sort of makes you respect the medium more and
think of it as a movie like not something that should have been told in 30
minutes but decided to reach 30 times long. So perfect blue is a good to
great movie about sort of the the creepiness that can come from fame plus the
internet. It's pretty cool to see a story that was told in 1997 or 1998
feels so modern. I mean of course there were computer. Computer related
stalking cases and even storylines like I'm pretty sure there's an episode of
the X-Files from maybe 96 that had to do with online dating and or celebrity
stalking can't remember but it's it's it feels more like a topic that would
be told in you know 2005 but it's being told with really hilariously old
computer. Also I need to get out of the way that it so much of what the movie's
going for is also gone for in inland empire now I wanted to be careful and not
accused one of influencing or being influenced by the other because I have
pretty high confidence that David Lynch has never watched any anime or if he has
it was like not as research for ideas or ads trying to respect peers that he
might you know other filmmakers I mean like the only time he's ever mentioned
that he's seen anything that was recent was like something from the 90s I think.
So I'm not saying and I don't really want to think in terms of perfect blue is
just in an empire but less wacky there is a little bit of that so I think the it's a
mistake obviously as a mature watcher of something to try to outsmart the
story where to think that you know the stories only there so that you can't
outsmart it so it's there was a time in my life where I would have watched
perfect blue and basically all of the thinking that I would spend afterward would
be which scenes reflected reality which scenes reflected the TV show and
essentially figure out which time she was getting confused versus things were
actually happening that appear to be confusing I think that obviously the movie
is not trying to just make that as a point so it's more respectful to take
every scene from what it is which is a demonstration of what it can feel like
when fame and digital media and your own self-perception can overlap and start
to blur also I think that it's slightly a commentary on dark moody bloody sexy
thriller stories you know there's one guy who says something like why do
all Japanese thrillers have to turn out that way and at first I thought that
was kind of a funny self-pig but I think that that's actually one of the main
things the story's trying to go for is you know during the rain scene especially
you as the viewer are not yet primed to think every scene that I see that's
dramatic could be in the show or could be real life like it's it seems pretty
clear that the script is calling for a rape at the strip club so that's what's
happening but it lingers on the details and the fact that they need to pause and
shift around the cameras it lingers for long enough for you if the audience
are still pretty uncomfortable like more so than you think you would be given
that you're told ahead of time that this is not real or you know so it doesn't
surprise me at all and I don't think there's any reason to read into this being
like an element of the hallucination she was upset by the experience it's foolish
to think otherwise and so I think that that's trying to say something true
about the constant push for our beautiful actors and actresses to keep doing and
being involved in such dark gross things right the audience of that show
double-bind is not going to see the rape scene in as much of a length of time
in detail as he did watching it or even the cast did making it so otherwise I
like that the movie tries to present a resolution that's not just you know
she goes and commits suicide and you know everyone's like confused about whether
it was you know I they did not the name of lift but this movie did not do what
he did in an empire which is have one of the most amazing forgetting that
you're watching a movie moments when that camera zooms out after she casts out
it dies on three which is like just the amazing turning point it perfectly would
be a little bit too hokey if it kept going going that way like you know that
that would be what I would consider a mid-level perfect blue impersonator movie
or TV show would do something like that where it's just that's leaning too much
into get the audience to be as confused as possible and that's the fun of it so
it you know it's interesting to think like what what does it say about the main
character that her that her mentor slash manager agent was going around
committing murder on her behalf and and writing the Irish entries pretending to
be the idle form of her it's it I mean I don't think it could be fun to watch
it again and try to spot all the different sort of opportunities that the
agent would have had to cause things to happen that you know like what she
avail was she known to be free when so so got killed or was she known to begin her
apartment when some crap crazy stuff happens in the apartment obviously she
sets up the computer and sends her to Mimi's room and she must have already
been writing the diary in periods which really just indicates you know I don't
think any of that would be all that deep except for the fact that the agent is
an ex-ital there seems to be some anxiety from her parents that she's
stopping being an idle and starting being an actress but it isn't it funny that
supposedly the motive of the murderer is keep up this fake version of a
person because it's the one you're comfortable with and obsessed with and that's
where you think successes or that's where you fix you know self-fulfilled it is
meanwhile what that person's actually doing instead is acting which is the kind
of the most voting thing that she could have moved to it's just trading one
the art of this for another so in you know that's why I think that the movie
is trying to say something or order about startup and fame and sort of putting
yourself out there for an audience but trying to keep part of yourself
called venting at the same time I did not feel sleepy or forget what I was
watching which is very common for sleek moody anime especially in movie for
Miyazaki I've never really felt too narcoleptic by but oh my gosh ghost in the
shell too is ghost in the shell too is like the exact opposite of end of
the spectrum of trying to achieve what they're going for compared to perfect
blue you know perfect blue is taking this concept of psychological problem
thriller and ghost in the shell too just leans in to wear animation so we can
just be as salient as we want but perfect blue is like a movie right you know
I've started to be less and less impressed with animated movies over time
because yeah I think it's kind of silly to think of them as genre because genre
is about more than and you know you can have an animated drama or an animated
comedy there there's no reason to walk those two together because that night
prompts people to think that there's something that they need to have allegiance
to there's no reason for someone who's a fan of anime comedies to like anime
drama but if you keep you know grief and thanks only as far as genre genre
genre and then medium then you get people who have go in with wrong expectations
so but I do sometimes think and I did in this one you know what is valuable about
this story being animated instead of my action and I think I've less impressed
with the visual angle of the visual aspect of animated movies over time
because there's a pressure to make things perfect for lack of a better term
but you can make anything you want in an animated movie so it's you know I'm not
going to go raving about a camera angle because there's no real camera I'm not
going to be raving about a color palette because like you see in JoJo Part 4
you can make a color palette wherever the day I want you want but I think that
this is better as an animated movie partially because it's about idols and
and Japanese dramas so it it's like another layer for the look the observer to
for the viewer to think about is if they're they're used to seeing or at least for me you know
idle actually go around to concerts for idle pop singers I'm familiar mostly about
idle pop singers through anime so it like you know maybe I like it more than the average
Japanese movie government 1998 would have liked or I like it less and it may maybe they
are like very into the real life counterpoint angle instead of seeing another layer on top
their eyes due to the tropes of anime but I think that this would have been if you were to make
this movie again shot for shot but in English with English actors it would be just as bad as the
death note remix death notes didn't even get the story right but even if you got this
story right for perfect blue it just wouldn't work because it would just look too goofy
to have you would need to do so much more camera trickery to cover up the psychological
weirdo details so in the final flight scene where it's switching back and forth between the idle
version of the woman and agent version and there's still a little bit of like confusion as to how
exactly everything's happening because she's obviously not jumping down like a like a fairy on top
of the light boosts but there does appear to be an actual funny fight in an alleyway
so the question then is how do you make that look good in a live action movie you'd have a lot
of darkness you have a lot of screen transitions and maybe even some terrible CGI and it would just
it would defeat the purpose I think of there's such a there's such a freedom in animation to
let something happen without making the viewer think too hard about how it's happening
and maybe so maybe that is a strain of animation compared to live action is that you can kind of
get away with whatever you want and therefore you can let a lot of things that would be
in your face in live action they can become sort of background noise or just tropes of the medium
so I think again overall good movie possibly great certainly in the realm of movies that are
tracing the struggles of an actress trying to keep her insanity like I've seen worse I've seen
better but it's not fair to think of perfect blue as just that that kind of story that I'd rather
see told in Mulholl and Thrive in Atlanta higher it's it is saying something unique especially
about the early computer realm and we're at least anxieties about the upcoming computer realm
because there's there's just a lot tied in to reading an online diary an online
diary is inherently creepy because there's really no reason to believe that the person writing
it is who they say they are I think that's why people were supposedly so mad when
Little Girl 15 was outed as an actress because you know I would definitely say that this
movie is prescient for the Little Girl 15 phenomenon and blogs but yeah so I I think that's
everything I have to say about that

8/10
