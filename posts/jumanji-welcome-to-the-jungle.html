        <p>Really cute movie, lots of really funny parts such as Jack Black peeing, the willingness to kill everyone off in horrible ways because there wouldn’t be any blood, etc. But the price of admission is more than made up for just to see The Rock pretend to be an awkward kid inside The Rock’s body.</p>
<p>The girl who plays Martha looks 100% like she is related to Karen Gillan, the casting there worked out perfectly.</p>
<p>I was SO MAD that I didn’t realize Nick Jonas was in the movie until the credits. I thought the guy looked familiar but couldn’t place him.</p>
