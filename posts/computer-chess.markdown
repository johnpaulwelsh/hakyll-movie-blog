I kind of loved this, basically uncategorizable (I guess you could call it a comedy but that's way selling it short). Just nerdy enough to appeal to things I know about. The way it captures the overlapping weirdness of the 1970s while also seeming to comment on modern anxieties is so interesting. The authentic and seemingly-unscripted nature of the performances is fascinating to watch, but the camerawork and editing constantly asserts itself to remind you that you're watching a movie and something weird is going on.

9/10
