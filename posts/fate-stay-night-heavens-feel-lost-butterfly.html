        <p>I watched the first movie when it premiered in 2017, then I read the visual novel path in February of 2019, very soon before this second movie premiered.</p>
<p>Watching a movie adaptation of a medium that was so fresh in my memory was kind of weird. I was anticipating so many things in the first chunk of the movie that I was worried I wouldn’t be able to just enjoy myself. I got more used to it though, especially once I realized how brisk the pacing would be.</p>
<p>When reading the VN I tried guessing what the cutoff for the second movie would be, and I was waaaaaaay off. Shirou getting Archer’s arm sewn on was my first guess, but the movie got to that point within like 30 minutes so I was pleasantly surprised. I personally think all visual novels suffer from bad pacing issues, just by nature of the medium. But I gotta hand it to Ufotable, they really know how to condense a VN into a compelling anime series (or movie (or three)).</p>
<p>I thought the sexual content was very well done, much better than in the VN. The dramatic arc was much stronger by making Sakura taste Shirou’s blood first, then masturbate the next day, then finally bite the bullet and ask him to make love to her. Jumping in to the hentai right away is clearly not the best way to tell the story.</p>
<p>Some of the early scenes were a little awkward, maybe because it felt like the action sequences were holding back. I’m especially thinking of the fight in the school where Shinji takes Sakura hostage. Something about the scene felt stagnant.</p>
<p>Overall, this is basically as perfect of an adaptation of <em>Heaven’s Feel</em> as a movie can get. The action was fantastic, the emotions were genuine and given the right amount of attention, and the animation itself was absolutely breathtaking.</p>
