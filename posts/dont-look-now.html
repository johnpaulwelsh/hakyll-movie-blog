        <p>Wow, this movie was really frustrating in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>I wish it didn’t bother me as much as it did, but the sound mixing is simply dreadful and feels really amateurish at times. There were some parts at the beginning where the ambient sound effects in the scene completely overpowered the husband’s dialogue, to the point where I needed to put subtitles on for the remainder of the movie. In my book, I shouldn’t need to put on subtitles to enjoy a movie that’s in English. It was also really obvious that they dubbed his dialogue in after the fact during some of the more action-y scenes, like when he’s trying to rescue his daughter from drowning or when he’s hanging from the scaffolding in the church. It was really distracting to hear every “uuggghh” and “whooooah” with crystal clarity, when all the other talking was mixed in the background where it belonged.</p>
<p>I have read that the camerawork and editing are really well-regarded in this movie, but most of the time I found it confusing in a bad way (not offputting in a good way). Scenes that didn’t seem to matter were shot like the cameraman was on cocaine: constant zooming in an out, sweeping back and forth while in close-up on someone’s face or on some everyday object, and the like. Instead of making mundane scenes feel unnerving, it just made them awkward. Likewise, some of the editing effects that were used to instill a mysterious or emotional tone usually came off as arbitrary or silly. Like a shot where Sutherland is climbing the scaffolding and a short overlay of the blind woman cackling appears - why is that in the movie? Does it imply that she’s cursed him, or that she’s watching it happen through her sixth sense, or what?</p>
<p>I guess my biggest complaint about <em>Don’t Look Now</em> is that there were a lot of pointless and vague scenes that didn’t really add up to either a cohesive story or a really effective mood of unease. For every creepy or intriguing scene, there is another scene that completely doesn’t compute with everything else going on. For example, when the blind woman and her sister are cackling in their room and no one is there. Or when she gropes her breasts and moans during the “seance.” Or when they are weirdly insistent on the husband and wife taking a shot of whiskey whenever they enter the hotel room they stay in. Each one of those sequences raises an interesting question about the characters’ motivations, but taken together it just seems random.</p>
<p>This applies to other characters too. For example, why was the police chief act so suspicious when he was talking to the husband if he didn’t end up mattering to the story at all?</p>
<p>It seemed like the movie would address themes of obsession or grief after the death of a child, or some other kind of metaphorical theme that could stand next to all the spooky stuff. But the wife ends up being fine after like 20 minutes of talking to the sisters and never seems to experience grief again, while the husband experiences hauntings that don’t really seem to be related to the loss of his daughter. It all seems like a framing device that goes nowhere.</p>
<p>After reading some more about the movie, it became clear that the dwarf was actually the serial killer that the Venice police were chasing in the background the whole time. Whether I missed that because I’m bad at making connections, or because the film failed to make me realize it, is a matter of debate I suppose.</p>
<p>Some of the visuals were really good, I will admit. And the general mood of the back alleys in Venice were quite menacing, almost reaching the point of “the setting being a character.” I’ve never really bought into claims such as that, since it usually means too much attention is drawn to meaningless mood shots of the filming location. But in this movie it more or less worked - Venice seems old, creepy, and full of secrets best left undiscovered. The smoky atmosphere in the climactic scene at the end was beautifully shot and I wish more was done with it.</p>
<p>Also, the sex scene was one of the only things I knew about the movie going in, and honestly it doesn’t belong in the film at all now that I’ve seen it. I think the opening scenes made me connect to the characters and believe their relationship more effectively than the lovemaking did, so it really felt superfluous. Sort of like when a “classic” action movie on TV is actually a complete throwaway, except for that <em>one scene</em> that nobody stopped talking about ever since it came out.</p>
<p><em>Don’t Look Now</em> is certainly not the worst movie I’ve ever seen, but it felt like a second-rate Twilight Zone story stretched over two hours. If this is a genre classic, I don’t understand why.</p>
