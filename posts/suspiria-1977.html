        <p>This is a movie of scenes and moments, and especially of set pieces. If you think too hard about what’s happening and why, you’ll miss what makes it so special. There are definitely some plot points that get a weird lack of attention, like whether the dog actually harmed the child (he seems fine near the end), or just dropped completely, like what Olga’s deal is at the beginning of the movie.</p>
<p>I could literally mention any scene as the most memorable one, but the courtyard where the blind guy dies is the one that I think stuck with me the most, it’s so spooky and expressionistic. Maybe also the witch’s corridor with the yellow lighting.</p>
<p>I honestly can’t believe how amazing the colors and lighting are, it’s a technical marvel and it paints such a wonderful mood.</p>
<p>Jessica Harper is very beautiful. Argento really knows how to pick a stunning leading lady.</p>
<p>It’s kind of unfortunate that the score only includes two tracks, until the end credits at least. They’re really good tracks, but compared to <em>Deep Red</em> the soundtrack of this movie sounds kind of samey.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
