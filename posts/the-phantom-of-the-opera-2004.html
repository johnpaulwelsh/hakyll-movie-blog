        <p>A 10/10 musical, hampered by some 6/10 or 7/10 directing decisions.</p>
<p>Some songs are shot 100% like a music video, and others have some of the worst blocking I’ve ever seen in a movie musical. So it ends up where half the songs focus too much on the faces of the singers, and the other half don’t focus enough on them. The boat trip with the candles was particularly cheesy, it almost felt like a parody of itself at times.</p>
<p>Some of the slower songs were pretty boring, even though I found them musically beautiful and would probably warrant their presence and length more readily in a stage play.</p>
<p>The girl who plays Christine does not do a convincing job of lip-syncing her voice. There are maybe two songs in the film where it looks like she’s really singing, when it comes to mouth shapes and breathing motions. She also spends about 10% of the film just looking blankly at someone or something else, it’s almost comical.</p>
<p>The songs of course are instant classics, I felt like I knew almost all of them just from cultural osmosis.</p>
<p>Credit where it’s due to Schumacher, the black-and-white framing device and the transition to the color scenes were awesome, especially that first one where the opera puts itself back together. I thought I was watching something from 2020 or 2021, instead of 2004.</p>
