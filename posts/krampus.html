        <p>The beginning section was really good, where the family is being hectic and Max is being despondent. I think it got across the feeling of “Christmas isn’t the same anymore” that they were going for. But the movie clearly doesn’t want to satisfy the emotional conflict it set up in the beginning, preferring to just punish everyone, so by the end it kind of pissed me off.</p>
<p>As the movie gets more into the creature-feature segment, I think it alternates between being entertaining and being kind of bland. And as it comes towards the end and you realize that nearly everyone is getting picked off one by one, I feel like it becomes less enjoyable and more lacking in taste. Like, you’d think they would at least spare the baby, but she just gets kidnapped and vanishes.</p>
<p>The stop motion flashback was a nice touch.</p>
<p>The designs of Krampus and his monster helpers were all great. I was personally horrified by the jack-in-the-box with the unhinging jaw, I actually hated that deep down in my stomach.</p>
