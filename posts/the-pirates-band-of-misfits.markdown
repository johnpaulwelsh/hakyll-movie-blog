It's cute and has a lot of funny stuff in it. The animation is pretty stunning, I was wondering "how did they do it?" for a lot of the action sequences. The storyline is funny for adults but goes way over kids' heads I think, at least until they're in middle school probably (when do people learn who Charles Darwin was?). Voice cast is well disguised, I didn't realize Martin Freeman or David Tennant are in this until the credits.

7/10
