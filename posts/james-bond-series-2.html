        <p><strong>8) <em>Live and Let Die</em> (02.14.21)</strong></p>
<p>There was a little part of my mind that was worried about all these black characters in a Bond movie. It seems right on the edge of exploitation, especially with all the voodoo stuff, but in the end I was much less offended by the yellowface in the earlier movies.</p>
<p>Roger Moore is a fine Bond in his first outing.</p>
<p>Solitaire is a really great Bond girl, partly because she gets more characterization than most others do. She’s also beautiful, but that’s par for the course. And she doesn’t get mercilessly killed at the end, thank goodness!</p>
<p>The movie gladly sidetracks itself during the speedboat sequence by throwing in the most over-the-top caricature of a southern sheriff ever. But it’s so damn funny, and the stunts themselves are so impressive, that I don’t think it hampers the film in any way. This is how you spice up aquatic action sequences (pay attention <em>Thunderball</em>).</p>
<p>The <em>Live and Let Die</em> musical cues throughout the film are probably the best use of theme music in the series so far. The song has so many memorable chords and melodies that you can sprinkle it in anywhere, and not only will it fit, but it will also be memorable as hell.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
<p><strong>9) <em>The Man with the Golden Gun</em> (02.20.21)</strong></p>
<p>A lot of little things conspire to make <em>The Man with the Golden Gun</em> my least favorite Bond movie so far. Bond is kind of a jerk, especially with his interactions with Goodnight. Goodnight herself is another ditzy companion, although she’s probably not the dumbest one so far. It was totally unnecessary to bring back J.W. Fuckface from Louisiana, although I enjoyed his involvement in the car chase a lot more than his boat ride and elephant escapades.</p>
<p>Not to say it was all bad. Christopher Lee is a great villain, the scenery was great, the action was well-choreographed and varied, and the silly spy stuff was very enjoyable (I just about lost my mind when the car attached to the plane and took off into the sky).</p>
<p>6/10</p>
<p><strong>10) <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> (02.27.21)</strong></p>
<p>For some reason this is the first movie in the franchise that I don’t have much to say about, other than “it’s fine.” Jaws is probably the most memorable villain henchman so far, even if they seem to have crafted him to be exactly that (he never even dies!).</p>
<p>7/10</p>
<p><strong>11) <em>Moonraker</em> ()</strong></p>
<p><strong>12) <em>For Your Eyes Only</em> ()</strong></p>
<p><strong>13) <em>Octopussy</em> ()</strong></p>
<p><strong>14) <em>Never Say Never Again</em> ()</strong></p>
