A truly mixed bag (of presents, heh).

Here's what I liked:

* the animation for the snow is honestly incredible, the most realistic CG snow I've ever seen.
* the gadgets and rhythm of the actual gift-stealing part of the story is really fun to watch.
* Max is a good boy (but his hair is dumb).
* the design of Whoville is really cool, it looks like the town inside a snowglobe and feels like it too.

But here's what I disliked:

* the narration is just absolutely terrible. The epitome of "tell, not show" comes when Pharrell is literally spoon-feeding us the feelings that the Grinch is experiencing when he's flashing back to the orphanage during the tree lighting ceremony. Like okay, have a flashback with some narration for the kids who can't read the word "orphanage," but please don't tell me "and that's why he was so overwhelmed and angry at the party, seeing the thing that he always missed out on was too much for him." The narration in general is probably half of why I don't like this version of the story, all the new lines (not from the book) are either lame or actively insulting to my intelligence (and to kids' intelligences too!). And his delivery! Pharrell sounds like he's sightreading the script and doing his very worst job at bringing any gravitas to the role. His voice is just too chill and high-pitched to ever come across as a good narrator.
* the Grinch's transition from "I just stole Christmas but felt kinda bad about it" to "I can't believe what I did, I must right this wrong" is hilariously short. He doesn't even really reflect on what the singing means, he kind of just vibes to the song and remembers what Cindi-Lou said and becomes the nicest guy ever. I think a lot of this comes down to the fact that he doesn't start out that mean to begin with.
* the music is terrible! Stop with the rap covers of old classics. Stop with the rattling high-hats!
* what the heck is Benedict Cumberbatch doing with his voice role? He sounds like he's doing Heath Ledger's The Joker off of memory. Why cast one of the world's most famous British actors and not only ask him to make his voice unrecognizable, but also to imitate one of the best acting roles in the last 50 years?

I can't help but compare it to the 2000 Jim Carrey version of _How the Grinch Stole Christmas_. I would probably guess that a lot of why I like that version and dislike this one is down to the fact that I Saw the Jim Carrey one when I was a dumb kid, and I didn't see this one until I was 31. They both have an unnecessary backstory for the Grinch. They both have stupid physical comedy and pratfall jokes. They both have an in-your-face zaniness to them (although Ron Howard was REALLY going off the deep end whereas this one is more like a Disney world 3D ride). But here are some actual points of comparison between the two which, in my mind, makes the 2000 version win the comparison:

* the distance between early childhood trauma and subsequent self-isolation and meanness is hilariously wide in the Jim Carrey version, but it comes from a real sense of identity and self-esteem. In this version it all comes down to being alone for Christmas for his whole life, which you would think could also lead to an extreme sense of nastiness in adulthood, but in this movie he's not even that mean! He loves his dog pretty much without reservation, and he feels guilt almost before he comes up with the plan for stealing Christmas.
* in the Jim Carrey version, the subplot of the Whos being shallow and focused on commercial matters makes Cindi-Lou's mission way more compelling and valuable. Her parents, the mayor, and all her neighbors all suck, and when the Grinch confronts them in the town party about that point, it honestly stings (even though it's kind of missing the point of why he in particular hates Christmas).
* Jim Carrey's Grinch is just way more entertaining than Benedict Cumberbatch's, even if it's probably very annoying for an adult.
* the freaking Illumination smile/smirk! It's everywhere! Every single character in this movie has the same smile and it's infuriating.

One other note: it's kind of shocking that multiple songs in this film are Christian carols or hymns. If you're going to mention Christ and Jesus and God in the first 10 minutes of the film, it's kind of obvious when you never bring them up again except to mention the halo on an angel on the tree.

At the end of the day, will I refuse to watch this again or to show it to my kids? Nah. But I will insist that only the original cartoon becomes the traditional December Grinch watch. The two remakes can be sometimes, but the 1966 version must be every year.

4/10
