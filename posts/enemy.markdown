The best word I can use for this movie is "gripping".

The story goes in a couple different directions which are all very refreshing - it doesn't string you along too long with the mystery of it, and it also doesn't bother to explain what's going on which has its good and bad sides.

I love that the perspective switches between the two guys, and including the wife in the mix might be my favorite part because it really grounds the story a lot.

Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor. Even when he was in the same room as himself (btw how tf did they do that??), I could easily tell which character was which by way he held himself and behaved in little ways.

I thought it was great that one character flaw in both of them is that they're defensive and suspicious when questioned, instead of being up front about it and talking like a normal person ("did you fuck my wife" vs. "did you see her again").

I think it's safe to say that I wouldn't have been able to guess the ending if I were given a trillion and a half guesses. Holy shit it gave me a heart attack too.

My jaw dropped when the wife told him she wanted him to stay, because I had been thinking for that whole scene that if she found out it was actually Adam, she would probably be better off keeping him because at least he isn't a serial adulterer who does sketchy things on the side. I also thought, she must know by now that it isn't her husband right??? And it looked like she made that exact calculation when I was thinking it, but it still surprised me because it was such a good dramatic resolution.

Music was great.

The movie feels like it's trying to get me to figure out the puzzle of what's going on, but it's also clearly dealing with metaphorical themes. The problem is, I don't know if I like how they mix. Below are the main mysteries left unsolved, and which I can't decide whether they're in there with the intent to be solved, or with the intent to stand in for some thematic thing:

# Significance of the quote at the beginning?

# Significance of discussion about dictators, control, and historical repetition?

# Significance of the professions of the two men? Actor and history teacher?

# Does the mother see both of them and think it's one person? The phone call at the beginning vs. the house visit near the end make it seem like she was talking to two totally different people, because she admits on the voicemail that the apartment is crappy, but in person she thinks he's an actor who likes blueberries.

# Is the weird spider sex dungeon there to just show that Anthony is a creep, or does it represent something else?

# Why is Adam having dreams/hallucinations about the spider if he wasn't the one who went to the sex dungeon? Or wasn't he...?

8/10
