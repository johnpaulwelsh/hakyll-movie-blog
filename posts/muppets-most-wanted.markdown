There are two kinds of Muppet movie - plot-driven, and joke-driven. This is one of the better joke-driven movies. Like of course it will never measure up to the original _The Muppet Movie_, but I think on the merits it's better than something like _The Muppets Take Manhattan_ which is too innocouous to be memorable.

The cameos in this one were off the charts. I always love that celebrities want to be in Muppet productions, that warms my heart.

The songs were just okay in this one, nothing will ever measure up to "Life's a Happy Song" from the previous movie. But I did enjoy "The Big House".

CGI Constantine flipping around on screen like some kind of Yoda is pretty lame. Whatever happened to the mind-blowing practical effects of Kermit riding a bicycle?

7/10
