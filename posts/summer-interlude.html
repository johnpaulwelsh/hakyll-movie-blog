        <p>I think I liked it, but more on a scene-to-scene level rather than the movie as a whole. I enjoyed the entire flashback portion because it was cute to watch the young couple, and the actress who plays Marie is very pretty. I thought the frame scenes are a bit weak in comparison, and I really don’t get the ending. So in that sense this is more on the wavelength of <em>A Ship to India</em> rather than <em>To Joy</em>.</p>
<p>What’s up with Bergman and giant flashbacks? I feel like more than half of the films I’ve seen by him have had very long flashback segments.</p>
<p>That animated sequence is so random, but so delightful.</p>
<p>I bet if I give it 10 years and watch it again outside of the context of this Bergman box set, I would enjoy it more on its own merits.</p>
<p>6/10</p>
