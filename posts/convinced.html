        <p>I don’t think I’m necessarily the target audience for this movie, but I thought it was quite good. There was a wide variety of interviewees with all different types of experiences, whether it be conversion from atheism, dedicated Protestantism, aimless Protestantism, etc. I liked that the movie showed a balance between intellectual pursuits and spiritual experiences that led all these people to become Catholic.</p>
