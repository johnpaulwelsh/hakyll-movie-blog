        <p>Somehow, this one is even better than the first movie. The jokes are funnier, the plot has more honest emotion, and it feels more like a “back to normal” long-form episode and less like a gimmicky “now we’re a movie” kind of deal.</p>
<p>Writing a stroke into Lassie’s storyline was a really creative and heartwarming way to explain why Timothy Omundson looks and acts that way (since he really did have a stroke).</p>
<p>I thought I was going to hate the Mary Lightly cameo when it started, but it was actually one of the funniest parts of the whole movie.</p>
<p>Also, we got to see Charlie and Toby from <em>The West Wing</em> hang out again!</p>
