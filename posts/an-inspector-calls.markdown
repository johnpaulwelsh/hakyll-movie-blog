It's good! Alistair Sim gives a great performance as the inspector. That ending is a real doozy, it really sows a seed of doubt in you that any of these stories were really about the same girl, and then a whammy of a twist in the last moment.

I think I'd like this less in the form of a stageplay, maybe the big emotions would feels more phony and eyeroll-inducing as a play.

It would have been easy to make all the members of the family into scuzzbags, but I like that they are all a little different in their attitudes and interactions with Eva Smith. And there really is a divergence between the older and younger generations, because the father and mother are much more in a position of power over Eva, whereas the younger ones are more involved in unfortunate circumstances instead. The exception is Shiela who does both - a youthful outburst of trying to behave like an entitled upper-class woman, but she comes to regret it almost immediately, especially in light of how her mother behaves when her story gets revealed.

8/10
