WONDERFULLY gross, but not just a gross-fest. There's clearly a lot of subtext and real human anxieties baked into this film, but I haven't figured them all out yet. It has body horror, relationship issues, and even a little bit of existential crisis at the end.

One of the main ones is toxic masculinity, although I wonder how the magazine editor boyfriend fits into that. He starts out being a total douche and Brundle is the nice guy, but it's not like they totally switch personalities. It's more like Brundle becomes more toxic (literally and figuratively) and Ronnie swings back to Douchey McButt because she can't deal with Brundle alone. I can't tell if this movie has a feminist streak or not, because of that.

The behavior of the computer that Brundle uses is probably the least realistic example I've seen in a while. Heck, even _Wargames_ is more reasonable than this. You can't just type in a question and expect the computer to answer it in an English sentence or two. Brundle himself says, "a computer is stupid, it only does what you tell it to."

Howard Shore's score is great.

I love that Brundle keeps his sense of humor and quirkiness throughout the whole movie. It would just be boring if he was lumbering around feeling sorry for himself as he got to the later stages of the disease, instead of actively trying to learn about it and find a way to reverse it.

All in all, it's clearly a classic. But it will be a long time before I want to see it again.

8/10
