        <p>The first thing I need to say about <em>First Reformed</em> is that it’s the realest movie I’ve seen in a long time.</p>
<p>Every little part of the movie is meticulously crafted to serve the telling of the story. Everyone in the film, but especially Ethan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried, gives absolutely stellar performances. Even the most minor of characters is imbued with an authenticity and unique personality, so after a while it felt like I wasn’t even watching a movie. And most of all, I feel like I know Reverend Toller better than I know almost any film protagonist. He’s so fully fleshed-out that the entire second half of the movie, I had a knot in my stomach because I could feel myself recognizing what he was thinking a brief moment before the movie communicated it to me. Of course that didn’t actually happen, but that’s how immersed I was in the inner workings of Toller’s mind.</p>
<p>But another way the movie felt so real to me is because it completely exists in our modern world. Anxiety about climate change sometimes feels like a current of boiling lava flowing just beneath the surface of our society. In general I am less pessimistic about the future of this planet than an activist like Michael would be, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t times that I’m stricken with desperation at the thought of what our shared future might look like.</p>
<p>I felt much the same way after listening to the podcast <em>S-Town</em>. In that story, a man struggled with personal demons and climate-based doomsdayism until it consumed him, and he took his own life. I became sullen for a period of time afterward because I couldn’t help but see a connection between the existential threat of a rapidly changing climate and the helpless emotional state John B must have been in for him to take his own life.</p>
<p>The ending of <em>First Reformed</em> really stuck with me, once I wrapped my head around it. Its ambiguity might be the most unsettling part of the film, not because it allows for a bleak option but because it allows for a redemptive one. I felt caught in a strange in-between place of not being sure what I thought Toller deserved in the end. Why would it feel more “right” for him to suffer and perish and cause suffering for others, because that’s what he was planning on doing? Do I really want to believe Mary was able to save him? Is the kiss at the end a sign of hope, or a manifestation of hopelessness?</p>
<p>Maybe that notion of “deserving” is part of the message of this film - judgment belongs to God, so it’s said, and as was said many times throughout the story, Do I suppose to know the mind of God?</p>
<p>9/10</p>
