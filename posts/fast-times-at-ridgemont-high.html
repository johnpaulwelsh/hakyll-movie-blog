        <p>I liked it. Good soundtrack, amazing cast. Phoebe Cates is so cute. Compare Jennifer Jason Leigh in this vs. in <em>Twin Peaks: The Return</em> or <em>The Hateful Eight</em> and it doesn’t even seem like the same woman.</p>
<p>I love how they put a “where are they now” at the end for all the characters, as if they are real people.</p>
<p>I wonder if teens in the 80s saw this to as accurate to their lived experience, or whether it was a fantasy the way it feels to us now in the modern era.</p>
<p>I don’t like the abortion element of the story, it’s handled a bit too casually for my tastes. But I guess I can’t expect much better from the 80s.</p>
