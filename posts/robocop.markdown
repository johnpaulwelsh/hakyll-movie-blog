_Robocop_ is kinda smart, kinda dumb, and all entertaining. It's like they came up with the central premise of a cop being turned into a robot, decided that it's a good opportunity to have a million guns and gallons of blood and a surprising number of flying appendages, but then also thought the hero needed to be sympathetic and the villains needed to be cartoonishly evil.

Like many violent 80s movies, there are some parts that are just sickeningly brutal. I'm mainly thinking of the guy who gets shot by the ED-209 at the beginning, and the criminal who gets covered in toxic waste at the end.

Robocop himself is pretty ridiculous. Lumbering around and speaking like a robot, I'm surprised they were able to make him seem cool and not just a slick Frankenstein's monster.

Every piece of satire was hilarious. I especially liked how the insane news broadcasts build the dystopian future world in such an efficient manner. The commercials felt like segments from _UHF_, especially the nuclear war board game. My favorite one is the car being called 6000 SUX and only getting 8.5 mpg.

And everybody is in this movie! Red from _That 70's Show_, Leonard Betts from _The X-Files_, and Albert and Leland from _Twin Peaks_!

Fun fact: the violent crime rate in Detroit in 1987 was 2544.88 per 100,000. In 2019, it was 2053.05.
