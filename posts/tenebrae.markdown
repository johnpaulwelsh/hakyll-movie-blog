A pretty solid movie from Argento, not the best but not the worst. I think the journey is much better than the destination with this one - there are some really excellent set pieces and moments in the first two thirds of the movie, but the payoff is just a little too convenient for me to feel emotionally invested in figuring it all out after it's been revealed. Two culprits can work, and hero-is-the-culprit can work, but combining them is a too confusing and feels cheap.

The acting is some of the best I've seen in an Argento movie, even the obviously-dubbed actors/actresses do a pretty good job instead of looking like they wandered in off the street (like some of the folks in _Crystal Plumage_ did).

The dog chasing the young woman is a little ridiculous, but it leads to one of the best sequences in any Argento movie I've yet seen, so I can forgive it a bit. That journey through the yard, basement, and house is fabulous and single-handedly convinced me this movie was worth my time to watch.

The music is pretty good, again, not the best and not the worst.

There are some scenes that are comfortable enough with the quiet that I felt a sense of artistic intrgrity that I usually don't feel from Argento movies. Especially the lead-up to the agent being killed, where he's sitting in the town square. Also the scenes with the mysterious woman in the red shoes, although once you know the backstory there it becomes less intriguing and more like, "what were those dudes doing on the beach? Rhode Island must have been a wild place back then."

I think the movie wants to have a meta-meaning about how the purveyor of gruesome murder mysteries is the real culprit of a real-life murder series, but I think that makes less sense when there are two culprits and only the second one fits that model. Also I was a little confused by the explanation the Italian detective gives at the end, I will need to read a summary to make sure I understand how Jane and the talk show host fit into it all.

Oh, and how about that camera movement around the house? That was pretty cool, at first I thought it was a little ridiculous because I knew it could not be the POV of the killer, but once it comes down the other side of the house it turns the corner into Coolsville.

7/10
