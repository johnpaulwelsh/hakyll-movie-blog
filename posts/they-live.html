        <p>My expectations were much higher for this one.</p>
<p>The one-liners aren’t that good and they feel totally jammed in, not natural to the character or the scene at all. Knowing the “bubblegum” line ahead of time, it made me think the movie would have a lot more comedy elements, something like <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em>, but in reality it was a much less interesting and exciting version of <em>Total Recall</em>. The movie is also way less smart than it thinks it is: the amount of satire/allegory you can milk from the concept of “the rich are vain monsters with no regard for the common man” is exhausted before you even see any aliens, just by watching commercials on the TVs.</p>
<p>Other complaints: - Too many slow scenes of action with the same stinkin’ music playing over it. I guess that’s a common John Carpenter problem, given how I felt about <em>Vampires</em>. - One unnecessarily long fist-fight scene that seemed just to be an excuse to have a wrestler do some wrestling in the movie. I’m seeing some people say it’s actually genius or the best part of the movie, maybe I need a certain context, but to me it felt totally pointless because it all ends with the guy trying the glasses on anyway. - An ending that’s sufficiently exciting and crazy, but also really abrupt.</p>
<p>The fact that it ends with the movie’s only sex joke seems to be the icing on the cake of how uneven this movie is.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>They Live</em> is massively overrated, and I think John Carpenter might be too. In my experience he’s more misses than hits.</p>
<p>Roddy Piper sounds like a Canadian Tom Hanks.</p>
