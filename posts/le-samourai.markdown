It's a cool movie. It's trying to be cool, and it succeeds, but at first I thought it wasn't as cool as it was trying to be. Up until the sequence in the police station I thought it was just okay. But something about the movement through those rooms and the camera work and the editing made me like it a lot more. Then it just got better from there.

I do think the title is trying too hard. Maybe I don't know enough about samurai tropes but Jef doesn't really embody the samurai way to the degree I expected from the title. It's not like _Ghost Dog_ where he explicitly reads Japanese stuff. You could have easily called this movie _The Hit Man_ and it would be just as good.

8/10
