        <p>When I first saw this, I think I didn’t quite get it, I was probably too young. I had almost no memories of it by the time I watched it this time around, just that it includes an old man dreaming about his childhood, I guess. Unfortunately, I still don’t think I fully get it.</p>
<p>It’s definitely enjoyable to watch, and there are some compelling scenes and sequences. I think I like the pieces more than the sum of their parts, maybe because I am able to fix meaning to the pieces better than to the film as a whole. I especially like the bickering married couple, the dream with the examination, and the stuff with the son and daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>I guess it’s a road movie where the various happenings on the trip give Isak time and space to think about his life, and how loneliness seems to pervade his family throughout the generations. But even though the ending is hopeful in regards to his son and daughter-in-law, I really don’t know how to feel about the conclusion of the story when it comes to Isak himself. Did he learn anything? Is he at peace? What “logic” did he piece together when he wrote down the events of the day? I am unsure about the answers to these questions.</p>
<p>Something I’ve noticed so far with my journey through Ingmar Bergman is that he can be very tell-y as opposed to show-y. But I think this film is an improvement over <em>Smiles of a Summer Night</em>, <em>Crisis</em>, and <em>A Ship to India</em> on that front. There are many scenes where stuff happens for the viewers to witness for themselves, and there is not a need to narrate it or put on-the-nose words in the characters’ mouths. The biggest offender that remains in the film is the actual characterization of Isak. We are told by everybody in his life that he’s cold and ruthless, but I fail to see those characteristics in his actual behavior. So something still feels disconnected between what the movie wants to tell me, and what I’m being shown.</p>
