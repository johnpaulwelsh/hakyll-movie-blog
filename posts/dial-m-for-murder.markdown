A classic. It's obvious that the story began as a play, but also it has enough of that Hitchcockian flair where it works as a film just as well.

Is Grace Kelly considered a good actor, or just an iconic beauty?

I swear that the first time I watched this it was black and white, but apparently that couldn't be the case. The colors looked so good once the movie got going that I forgot all about it anyway.

9/10
