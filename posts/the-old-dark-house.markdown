Half of this is fun, the other half is dull and pointless. The best parts are the beginning before they get to the house (maybe the best depiction of a miserable rainy night I've seen), any time Horace is on screen (especially when he doesn't want to go upstairs to get the lamp), and the parts with Saul. The worst parts are the after-dinner discussion and the romance subplot. Learning about these characters is not what I'm interested in, I want to see Rebecca be a crabby prude, Horace be a wimp and asking for folks to eat some potatoes, and Morgan lumber around and look menacing. The atmosphere of the house is pretty good, but in the years since this film there are so many better old dark house movies I'd rather watch instead, ones where the story is more horror or else more comedy.

5/10
