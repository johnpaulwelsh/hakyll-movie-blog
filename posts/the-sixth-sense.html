        <p>Pretty much everything in this movie works, and NOT just on the first watch, and NOT just on the second watch. Anyone who says this movie is only good the 1st or 2nd time is a liar, or is willfully ignorant about what makes the movie compelling either of those times. I feel like anyone who reduces the movie down to just the twist, is totally missing the heart at the center of the movie.</p>
<p>Sure, the movie works as a puzzle, and certainly it’s fun to see all the spots that look totally different after knowing the twist. But much like <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, there’s an emotional core to the story and a real sense of development. I don’t know if there’s theme in <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, it doesn’t get as lofty as that. Sometimes a movie just needs to tell a good, human story, and this one does.</p>
<p>Haley Joel Osment is the glue that holds the film together. He’s not afraid of being on camera and acting the heck out of the scene, and thankfully Shyamalan is not afraid of keeping him on screen for however long he needs to for the scene to work. He’s not the only good part of the movie, but even all the other great elements would suck if the kid actor wasn’t an ace, and HJO is certainly that.</p>
<p>Toni Colette only seems to play distraught mothers, in my experience. She’s excellent in this movie.</p>
<p>I don’t know what happened to M. Night Shyamalan after this. Eventually both his writing and directing got bad, but I’m certain that he did a good job in <em>The Sixth Sense</em> on both fronts. I know I liked <em>Signs</em> but that might have just been good writing and sub-par directing, or the other way around.</p>
