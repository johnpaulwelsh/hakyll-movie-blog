I am ignoring all differences between the film and the books, because I never read any of them. My wife filled me in after the fact on the major differences but it did not impact my opinion.

This is a perfect example of a poorly-developed blockbuster fantasy movie that leaves absolutely no impression on the viewer. The only part that seemed well-defined was the society structure of the fairy world. But everything else was sloppy and half-baked.

- I didn't believe for a second that Artemis was a genius, other than I was told he was.
- The little black girl who shows up doesn't actually do anything useful.
- The antagonist is totally empty, might as well not exist.
- It seemed like Artemis's absent father would be a major influence on his characterization, but it's completely thrown out as soon as it's established.

I think a bunch of the movie could have been improved by making one simple change - making Artemis the narrator instead of the dwarf guy. It would give a lot more insight into the personality of the main character, and it would make the story a lot less "telly" and more "showy".

At least it isn't as bad as the _Death Note_ movie.

3/10
