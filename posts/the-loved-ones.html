        <p>The biggest problem with this movie is that it’s a slasher, but it also has a lot of sad dramatic parts. So I just feel bad about the things that happen, in a way that I wouldn’t feel if it were like <em>Terrifier</em> or some other typical “nobody’s life matters” slasher movie. Actually in general, the tone of this movie is pretty unforgiving and brutal, even though you could argue it has a happy ending. I was entertained the entire time and I wasn’t particularly offended by anything, but there are a lot of issues with the movie that lower my opinion of it when taken together.</p>
<p>Let’s split it into storylines, since that’s kind of naturally how the movie plays out.</p>
<p>The scenes where the friend goes to the prom with the goth girl were all pretty entertaining in their own right, but I was wondering the entire time why I was being shown the events of their night, since it didn’t look like anything gruesome was going to happen to them. I think it definitely lightened the mood whenever it cut back to them, but I think the way it all ends is pretty stupid. It almost seems like her entire character is set up as a way to indicate how much it injured their family when her brother disappeared. (Which by the way, he didn’t disappear. He was found wandering around in the desert when Brent and his dad got into the accident, and he was alive. Why do they act like he’s still “whereabouts unknown?”) I think I would have preferred it if the goth girl just stayed as a stereotype with no emotional baggage underneath, because then at least I could mindlessly enjoy her characterization. Also the principal is actually the chillest dude ever. He’s pretty fair when he catches the kids groping, and then outright fucking on school campus. He’s just like “please do this somewhere else.”</p>
<p>The “searching for Brent” storyline was just sad and dramatic, and I was really worried that Holly was going to get killed near the end because she seemed like a really nice girl. The dog didn’t need to die either, that was just mean.</p>
<p>I was on the edge of my seat for much of the rest of the movie, where Brent is trapped in the house. Some of it was surprisingly brutal, lots of bludgeoning and stabbing and sharp instruments in general. But again, some of it was just mean. Like Bright Eyes? Why is she here, other than to foreshadow the head-drilling scene and then die for no real reason? And where in the blue blazes did the cannibal angle come from? I will admit that part surprised me in an enjoyable way, but in hindsight it could have easily been something more ridiculous and I think I’d have liked it more. Like just go for aliens or werewolves or something at that point. And also, the incest angle is there just to make some people uncomfortable. But I do think the moment-to-moment thrills of the crazy stuff the girl and her dad get up to makes for a fairly entertaining (and squeamish) time, so it’s not so much bad, as flawed.</p>
<p>Pretty much the only satisfying storytelling element in the movie is that Brent climbs his way out of the cavern, like he was shown doing at the cliff near the beginning, which must be a symbol for his trauma or something. Everything else seemed thrown in to move the scenes along, as if it were a mere slasher flick.</p>
<p>I think the movie relied on music/soundtrack too often, it came across as very amateurish. Like did there really need to be some heavy metal riffage when the goth girl first showed up? Seemed more like a trick you’d pull in a TV pilot.</p>
<p>Also I’m usually not one to complain, but did we really need such a lengthy makeout/sex scene in the beginning between Holly and Brent? It’s not like the nature of their relationship comes into play very much throughout the rest of the movie.</p>
<p>5/10</p>
