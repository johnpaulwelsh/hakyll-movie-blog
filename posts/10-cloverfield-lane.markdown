Going in to this second _Cloverfield_ installment, I was fearful that the first movie's brilliance was mostly a fluke, and so _10 Cloverfield Lane_ would just be a passable thriller with a nice twist ending, but not too much to say otherwise. I was more or less right, but I still enjoyed the movie.

My biggest complaint is that the tone of this movie was all over the place. Most of it felt like a mystery/thriller, with a lot of back-and-forth about whether Howard could be trusted. For a while I bought into it, because the proof and doubts of his telling the truth fluctuated in a believable way that legitimately kept me guessing.

But after a while, I think the movie tried to put in a bunch of other elements just to make sure that core mystery could last about 90 minutes. Sometimes this meant amping up the excitement when an "action" scene was coming up, which could probably work better in isolation or in a different movie altogether. I was becoming suspicious of this kind of amp-up tactic even during a scene at the beginning of the film, namely when Michelle was turning her crutch into a spear. I mean, she *obviously* isn't going to succeed, so it felt a little cheap to put some dramatic music behind her little wood-carving montage.

Other times the film injected some scenes that are simultaneously lighthearted and twisted, like the primary dinner scene or the game of Taboo that they play together. The mood that these scenes cast were very reminiscent of Tim Burton, and his particular style of zany dark humor, but in the context of the movie it felt a little out of place. Any maybe this is me just being unfair, but I get the feeling that kind of thing is bound to happen in a PG-13 thriller movie, adding in scenes that make attempts at humor but just end up feeling awkward. The PG-13 rating probably also explains why there isn't a whiff of sexual tension in the whole story.

Ultimately though, I don'y want the movie to be something it isn't. Making it only about how three people survive in the event of a catastrophe would take most of the charm out of it. While making it a full-on mystery wouldn't make sense to last as long as it does.

The music was very fairytale-esque and sometimes it was so bombastic and high-gloss that I lost focus on the visuals and just enjoyed listening to the score. it's not that the music messed up any of the scenes it was on top of, but it definitely helped contribute to the not-quite-dead-serious tone of the whole movie.

Poison gas was kind of a cop-out

7/10
