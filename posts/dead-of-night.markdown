One of the few anthology movies where the frame story is equally interesting as the individual stories.

The camera usage in the first story was really good, I was bracing myself for a jump scare the whole time.

The story with the little kid in the mansion might be my favorite out of the bunch.

I liked the mirror one but I think it lasted a little too long compared to the others. The music is pretty over-the-top in this segment.

The golf one is hilarious and provides a much needed breather in the overall story.

The ventriloquist story feels more sophisticated than other versions of this same story, if only because his dialogue is less cartoonishly evil and more just abusive.

The ending is pretty well done, given that it's not the most original thing in the world. I especially liked the way the opening scenes play again under the credits, but with crazy music playing instead of the original sound track. And I will admit, the "room for one more" guy was pretty creepy.

I think in order for Scorsese to think this is one of the scariest movies ever, he would have to have seen it as a nine- or 10-year-old and had his mind blown by the premise of the frame story. I wasn't nearly as impressed as he is, but I think it's a pretty solid little horror movie from the 40s.

7/10
