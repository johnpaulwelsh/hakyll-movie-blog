Uneven, but pleasant. Compared to _The Muppets Take Manhattan_ it has even less of a real story, but overall I liked it more.

Some of the funniest scenes in any Muppet movie are here, including the John Cleese cameo, the newspaper office scene in the beginning, and the _____. The songs are fine, and the dance scenes and Miss Piggy dream-sequence stuff are surprisingly effortful, although they are still a little boring. Jim Henson's obsession with overly-sentimental Kermit-Piggy content is on full display here, I would take the fluffy stuff from _The Muppet Movie_ or _Muppet Treasure Island_ over this any day of the week.

7/10
