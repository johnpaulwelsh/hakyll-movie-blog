I think I liked it, but more on a scene-to-scene level rather than the movie as a whole. I enjoyed the entire flashback portion because it was cute to watch the young couple, and the actress who plays Marie is very pretty. I thought the frame scenes are a bit weak in comparison, and I really don't get the ending. So in that sense this is more on the wavelength of _A Ship to India_ rather than _To Joy_.

What's up with Bergman and giant flashbacks? I feel like more than half of the films I've seen by him have had very long flashback segments.

That animated sequence is so random, but so delightful.

I bet if I give it 10 years and watch it again outside of the context of this Bergman box set, I would enjoy it more on its own merits.

6/10
