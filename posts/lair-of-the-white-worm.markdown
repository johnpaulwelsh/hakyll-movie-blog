This movie comes off as extremely weird until you realize that it's just a corny monster b-movie in color with a legit cast and well known director. Then it becomes much easier to enjoy on its own terms. Seeing Hugh Grant and the 12th Doctor in this was pretty trippy, I can imagine it would have been fun to reach their later levels of popularity and remember back to this strange interlude in their careers.

My reaction to the film flipped back and forth between smiling from enjoyment and saying "haha what". The intentional comedy scenes initially threw me off because it felt more appropriate to play it straight, but I think that would only have worked in the heyday of cheap monster movies. In the late 80s we all knew that you can enjoy b-movies ironically so adding actual jokes (Snakes and Ladders? Come on) feels more appropriate in that light.

The introduction of supernatural elements cracked me up, all of a sudden the suspicious woman down the road gets fangs and snake eyes for a split second. If this were an old cheap b-movie it would come across as very cheap, but here it was really funny.

The flashes of lascivious sacrificial imagery looked like bad heavy metal music videos, or like a render in the game engine for Doom 1993. Even for a consiously funny movie I don't know how that ever got the green light, it looks absolutely terrible.

"False god" my ass. If the snake god really got banished to darkness by Yahweh the God of Israel then of course Yahweh is the true God. It's the same issue as vampire stories, the crucifix and holy water only work if Christianity is true. Listening to Lord of Spirits made me appreciate how actually realistic and true to form the climactic pagan ritual is. Phallic violence with relation to virginal sacrifice, it's all super legit.

The danston worm song is a banger.

I really enjoyed the performances in this movie. Especially the main four characters talking together, I could watch another 30 mins of that. They just have good chemistry. And the accents don't hurt.

Now I really want to read the original beam stoker story to see if it's played straight. I imagine it is, which really begs asking, who the heck conceived of making this goofy movie and secured the funding for it? And how did they convince the Sylvia actress to be nude or dressed like an escort so often?

You know what, in hindsight I think I liked this more than I previously thought. Up from 7 to 8.

8/10
