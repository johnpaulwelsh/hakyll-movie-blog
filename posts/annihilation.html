        <p>I read the books first (the whole trilogy) and I loved them, so I was pretty surprised to see how different the movie is after establishing the basic premise of “Area X, team of women scientists go in at behest of government agency, weird stuff happens.” I usually don’t think it’s fair to directly compare plot points between books and their movie adaptations, but in this case all the things that changed for the movie were universally inferior.</p>
<p>The main character, Lena, is a perfectly average married woman with an adulterous secret nagging at her, as opposed to the detached, moody, and isolated (not to mentioned unnamed) Biologist from the book. The government agency is kind of grasping at straws in both versions, but in the book it’s clear they are desperate for a breakthrough after decades of rigorous but futile missions, while the movie depicts them as kind of clueless and almost reckless. This ends up making the mission feel a little arbitrary and takes away the underlying importance of this particular group of women, and why their story is worth telling.</p>
<p>Where the book rests under a mountain of ambiguity and little glimpses of what might be happening in Area X, the movie becomes a string of vaguely related body-horror setpieces. Since the screenwriter only read book one of the series before coming up with the screenplay, it makes sense that he wouldn’t have tied these scenes together with the thread the book eventually gets around to. The conclusion the movie does come up with, however, is only a little bit interesting on its own, and just contributes more to the “we didn’t think this out very much” levels of ambiguity that pervades the movie.</p>
<p>Where the movie really becomes interesting in its own right is where it most dramatically breaks with the source material - the final act. As far as unsettling and thought-provoking alien encounters go, this one is pretty effective (helped a lot by a balls-crazy musical score). But it also goes against the entire logic the movie had been building up so far. If the alien force is manipulating the biological and genetic structure of everything in Area X, why would the personification (in the form of the Silver Surfer) become a mimic of Lena? The movie starts by making its alien presence a morally neutral invasive species that simultaneously taints and amplifies the natural environment it embeds itself in… but ends up deciding that <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> is a better idea. I struggled to see the connection between these two ideas, so in the end the movie seemed to get lost in its own imagery.</p>
<p>All this being said, I can’t say I hated the movie. After the initial bad taste in my mouth from the early plot alterations, I kind of slid into a general interest in what was happening on screen, flavored with a healthy distrust that everything would tie together nicely. In that sense I guess the movie met my expectations.</p>
