Unfortunately, it's pretty bad.

I think the film has a couple of major plot holes, almost like it was written to have a different twist. Like if Anna was responsible for everything past the halfway point, then who called the phone when Marco was watching cartoons? That couldn't have been faked. And how did she shoot Marie but then appear outside the museum when she hears the police sirens?

Then again, the thematics of the actual twist make more sense than the culprit being someone else. She gets a blonde wig, that makes it pretty obvious in hindsight. And it's kind of an interesting story to have a rape victim take on the personality of the rapist as a traumatic response.

The scene where Alfredo traps her in the sewer is way too long and unpleasant to watch, I got pretty bored at that point.

The Stendahl Syndrome element is wasted, unfortunately. There doesn't seem to be any reason for her condition except that it makes for some cool shots, and it's an excuse to film lots of paintings and sculptures. She loses the illness right as she kills Alfredo, which kind of makes sense as a transitional moment, but it squanders an interesting plot element. Imagine how good the movie could have been if she kept the illness the entire time, and the oppressive nature of Italy and all its art ended up factoring in more. The movie did make me realize just how many paintings and sculptures are all over the place in Italy.

The acting by Anna's father is pretty bad, especially at the dinner table when his eyes are popping out of their sockets.

There are some really questionable visual effects shots throughout, like pills being swallowed, the bullet going through the woman's cheeks, and paintings dissolving. Maybe the wost CGI I've seen since _The Langoliers_.

The paintings that Anna paints are pretty awesome, actually.

There are little bursts of gonzo genius which I wish were pursued more. Like fishy kisses at the beginning, or the other "entering paintings" scenes.

Ultimately I think Anna is poorly written and poorly acted. She starts acting unreasonable and antisocial even before she gets raped, it's just annoying to watch her do things because she's suspicious and unlikeable.

At least the music is better than in _Trauma_.

4/10
