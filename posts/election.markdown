The distance between my final score for this movie and the number of times I laughed is pretty wide, but I just think there's something about the sense of humor and pacing of this movie that bugs me. It's simultaneously not black enough of a comedy (no school shooting? come on that's where I thought it was going for the whole movie) and also pretty punishing for the people who suffer in the storyline (Jim's wife didn't deserve that at all). Also the ending seemed to drag on, although the very end where Jim thinks he's had a good life while Tracy's must suck, is pretty great.

Also I watched this with my wife and our exchange student and it was pretty uncomfortable with all the sex scenes and infidelity.

But it was funny for sure! I especially love Paul, he is such a sweet dimwitted guy. I also thought Tammy's storyline is really funny, even though it doesn't really feel like it belongs in this movie.

7/10
