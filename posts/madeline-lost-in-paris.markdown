I always remembered this movie has having a surprisingly dark story, and I'm glad to see I was right upon rewatch.

I'll admit the songs are pretty catchy, and it's all very wholesome and friendly even when there's blatant child abuse and forced labor as integral elements of the story.

Do they really make lace out of human hair? I need to learn about lace.

7/10
