Somehow I almost like this one better than the first one. Although there are some really complex story developments, it's much more of an action movie and I think it hits the balance better between sci-fi nonsense and ass-kicking than the first movie does.

The many-Smiths fight is one of the highlights for sure. In fact I think Smith is one of the most enduring entertainments of the whole _Matrix_ series. The Keymaster is adorable too. The music hits so hard, especially during the freeway chase scene, that I was laughing out loud at points due to how ridiculous it all is.

My wife accused the movie of being written by and for nine-year-old boys, and I can't help but agree with her. But I think it's fun to turn off your brain for a while and pretend you're a nine-year-old boy again, and _The Matrix Reloaded_ definitely allowed me to do that.

7/10
