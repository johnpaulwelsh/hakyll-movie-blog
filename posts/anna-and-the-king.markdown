This is a really nice movie, but I feel like it only makes sense if you vaguely remember _The King and I_ from maybe a high school play or a long-ago viewing of the musical movie. If I were to have watched this without any prior context, I would have been super thrown-off by how articulate and smart the king of Siam was in the 1860s, especially in his mastery of not only the English language but also English sense of humor. Now obviously this is a movie, so he probably wasn't snarking all over Anna in real life, but it's still easier to swallow such an unusual story if you're aware it's based on actual events and/or remember the premise from a previous adaptation.

As far as weaknesses, there aren't that many, but the story itself kinda seems uneven at times. The dramatic elements never really seem to jive together super well. On their own, the more dramatic plotlines such as the concubine and the monk getting killed and the anti-imperialist coup are pretty interesting. But for some reason it feels awkward for them all to be in the same movie, because they all distract from each other and from the central King-and-Anna story. Meanwhile the big climax is kind of a mild _Bridge on the River Kwai_, and it isn't too impressive.

Other than all that, I thought it was a great movie. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat are excellent in their roles, and the little kids are sooooooooo kyute!

8/10
