        <p>This is a movie I’m comfortable saying is too long (the director’s cut I mean). Also, it’s a pretty bad way to learn for the first time what the heck happened in China and Japan between 1900 and 1950. It gets pretty hard to follow after Manchukuo is formed, but even before that I couldn’t keep track of whether Communists or free people were in charge of China at any given time before 1950.</p>
<p>The movie is very stately which works most of the time, but can also make it kind of dull. Also the emperor is not very sympathetic, at really any point in the story.</p>
<p>I also watched it on the worst DVD copy of anything that’s ever been made. It’s “4:3 fullscreen” which means nothing is panned or scanned, but also it squeezes the widescreen picture into a fullscreen-ish frame, so on a modern TV it shows up as a small picture inside 4 black bars, one on each side. Ridiculous. And there’s no subtitles, even as an option!</p>
