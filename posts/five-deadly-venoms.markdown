I watched this film relatively late at night on a weekend in its original Cantonese with subtitles, and it felt like the perfect movie to watch at that time of night when you feel pretty tired but want to stay up and see what happens.

It takes a little while to get used to the silly sound effects, but it's fine after the first couple fights.

The story is more involved than I expected it to be. It's interesting to have the Venoms collaborating with each other, and especially how the Snake wields the local police power to his advantage using ultra-obvious corruption. Especially the fact that the identity of each Venom is doled out so evenly across the runtime of the movie. It might have been obvious off the bat which characters were Venoms, but I like how it takes its time revealing each particular Venom. And saving one as a surprise for the end was a great idea.

I'm surprised I didn't have that much trouble following the plot after a while. There are some spots in the middle third of the movie that get a bit hairy, like who the two guys are in the restaurant that tell the Gecko what happened while he was gone, and how they came to find out how The Toad, Mufta, and Lin had died.

The final fight is really stellar, and worth the wait.

The music is really good, it uses lone instruments in interesting ways.

I like how it always does a close-up of someone's face to confirm they have died.

The blood is the least convincing blood I've ever seen.

I like how the plot basically just wraps itself up in a couple of lines of dialogue, after the final fight finishes.

The special effects of the Gecko and last student standing on the walls are awesome.

I LOVE the way the camera moves, it really lives up to the cheesy kung-fu camera style I have come to expect from watching Tarantino.

8/10
