Really funny. I wish I had more to say but that's all, I laughed a lot.

I'm surprised I didn't get sick of hearing the same song performed four times.

It's fun to see football being played 90 years ago and seeing that it's basically the same game.

My wife was uncomfortable with all the groping and kissing that the women in the movie needed to endure, and she's got a point.

There were some really awkward cuts during the scene where Chico performs on the piano, while everybody is running around. \[EDIT: turns out that's an artifact of lost footage, it can't look any other way at this time in history.\]

8/10
