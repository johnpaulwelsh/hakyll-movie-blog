        <p>I’ve concluded that this series is trash. Luckily, it’s fun trash.</p>
<p><em>Cloverfield</em> was an accidental stroke of genius. <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> was uneven but had good ideas and memorable execution. The best way I can describe <em>The Cloverfield Paradox</em> is that it tries to outdo both of the previous films in terms of raising the stakes and amping up the style, and is only prevented from failing completely because it doesn’t take itself too seriously.</p>
<p>I was worried this movie would be the most boring out of the three so far, and I can at least say I was totally wrong about that. Instead of cooking up some kind of horror/thriller plot and throwing it in space, it goes straight to the “uh-oh we broke the whole multiverse” route, which results in some truly excellent b-movie fare.</p>
<p>Of course, the logic of it all starts falling apart before even the halfway point of the film. If we’re assuming the only problem is that two dimensions are colliding and messing each other up, that totally explains why a crew member from another timeline would appear in the body of the ship. But I can’t comprehend why the gyroscope would have found itself inside the guy who vomited up worms, or why magnetic glue would have become sentient and attacked the guy who lost an arm. Even with a free-for-all sci-fi premise, <em>The Cloverfield Paradox</em> still manages to make absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know whether all of the movies are supposed to have the same continuity. The first and second films looked very much like they were set in the years they were released (2008 and 2016 respectively), but this is clearly set in the far-future compared to either of them. The only consistent thing across all the films seems to be the invasion of Earth by alien monsters, but it can’t be the same invasion event because the years don’t line up at all. Even if you assume the first two films occurred in alternate dimensions from that shown in <em>The Cloverfield Paradox</em>, the aliens don’t even seem to be the same species across movies (<em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> being the biggest outlier).</p>
<p>All that being said, I more or less enjoyed the movie. As compared to the previous film which disappointed me for its lack of compelling ideas, this one was bursting at the seams with cool ideas that came together to make a messy and ridiculous whole in the end. I can’t say it’s “good,” but it’s certainly fun, and honestly that’s enough for me at this point.</p>
