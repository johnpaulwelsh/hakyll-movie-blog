The fatal flaw with this film is that it's exhausting to watch so much great action with the only respite being very broad comedy, or boring talking scenes. But man is the action great. I was continually dazzled. It's amazing to me that there were enough working choreographers in china or HK to make so many of these crazy movies.

7/10
