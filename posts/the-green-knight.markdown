The movie really nailed the feeling of this tale being very very old, and not just a modern piece of fiction set in a historical time. It makes me really want to read the original poem, to see how much of the story is spot-on and how much is artistic license. I would not be surprised if the plot points were all identical, but they just differed in presentation.

Psychedelic is the right word for it. I've never seen unnatural color used in a naturalistic setting so effectively. Lots of scenes feel like they're going to spin off the rails and start being crazy for their own sake, but by the end of the movie pretty much everything that happens has a purpose and fits into the greater story.

The music was beautiful and creepy in equal measure, sometimes all in the same scene.

I feel bad for all those losers who came into this movie, didn't like how weird it was, and came out to give a CinemaScore of C+. It's the same thing as _Hail Caesar_, and seemingly every A24 movie that isn't a straight drama. Y'all just don't know a good movie when you see it.

I'm glad I saw it in a theater, but simultaneously I think it looked less high-quality on that screen compared to if I had a Blu-Ray copy at home. I'll definitely get this on hard-copy and watch it for Christmas :)

9/10
