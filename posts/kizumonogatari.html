        <p><em>First two portions watched on April 29, third portion watched on April 30.</em></p>
<p>Overall I think <em>Kizumonogatari</em> is pretty good. In my experience, prequel stories can only be so interesting compared to the rest of the series, and this one tells a good-enough story with some really memorable, but occasionally questionable, execution tactics.</p>
<p>The main thing I need to bring up is the animation itself… I don’t know why the lunatics at Shaft decided to go so off-the-wall with the character design for these movies, but holy crap it’s hard to get used to. I spent nearly the whole first movie bothered by everyone’s shiny cheeks and knees, Hanekawa’s mind-of-their-own boobs, and the constantly-shifting style of Araragi’s facial expressions. Interestingly, Hanekawa’s boobs are most distracting when they’re not the focus of the scene. The “please touch my breasts” scene in part III is pretty great even though it made me uncomfortable, but everything leading up to it is just annoying because of how extreme the boob-flopping is.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the kinetic art style is really great in other areas, like in the background environments or in short interlude scenes. I liked the way Shaft includes photographs into their animation back when I watched <em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</em> and it shows up here a good amount. I don’t think the animation gimmicks are used for comedic purposes as much in these movies as they are in, say, <em>Nisemonogatari</em>, but when it is used that way it’s excellent (especially any shots with cartoony/chibi characters).</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say that Kiss-Shot is the cutest thing ever in all her forms and at all times. Maybe the most rewarding part of this film series is seeing Kiss-Shot before she becomes Shinobu. And in two loli forms instead of just the one, what a deal!</p>
<p>Overall the fight scenes are stellar, especially in part II which is why I rank that one so much higher than the other movies. The final fight between Araragi and Kiss-Shot is so over-the-top I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Araragi’s torso landing backwards on his legs while they ran around the racetrack is top-tier ridiculous.</p>
<p>As far as watch order, I’d say it’s hard to make up my mind. The characterization of Hanekawa definitely is one of the biggest variables that this movie impacts. Her dedication to Araragi comes through in the movies in a way that isn’t quite there in <em>Bakemonogatari</em>, so it might be good to get that background info before watching the standalone Hanekawa arc and the first arc of <em>Second Season</em>. But I also think it’s a good idea to watch the movies early so as to avoid disappointment. By the time I watched them in the original release sequence, most of the big reveals were small potatoes in my mind. It was interesting to see Episode in a different context than that one arc in <em>Second Season</em>, but he’s arguably more important to the story of <em>Kizu</em> so it’s fine to see that first and let <em>Second Season</em> be a neat cameo. And while the stuff about Kiss-Shot’s first servant is much more engaging in the version from <em>Second Season</em>, there are details in that version that aren’t covered in the movies so I think it’s fine to see <em>Kizu</em> first as a taster.</p>
<p>My arguments for watching it in release order are more vague and not currently solidified, because I just went through it myself so I’m still processing.</p>
<p>Other than the wackiness with the style, my main disappointment is that the story kinda just skitters to an end. It makes sense generally why Kiss-Shot and Araragi do what they do and feel what they feel in the final showdown of part III. But it feels like Oshino just swoops in and announces how the events of Golden Week will lead into the events of <em>Bakemonogatari</em>, without much room for original content to fill in those gaps. During all three movies I wondered how Araragi would go from being a conventional no-sunlight vampire to being the half-vamp that he is in the main series, and it was rather lame to see the answer be, “Oshino recommends it as a compromise so that both Kiss-Shot and Araragi can be miserable forever.” I really enjoy the master/servant dynamic between those two characters so I’m not as much of a fan of the wimpy way this arrangement comes about.</p>
<p>But the music is great throughout.</p>
<p>I: 7/10 II: 9/10 III: 7/10 Overall: 7/10</p>
