Holy fuck this movie scared me. It scared me until I almost felt sick. It was a throbbing gut kind of fear, which pretty much didn't let up for 90 minutes right up until the end.

The first half of the film is pure agony, I don't know how else to describe it. There's nothing wrong with the execution, but I guess just the story being told is by its very nature hard to watch. The way it dwells on grief and anxiety in such detail really puts a hole in my stomach.

Then the second half decides, "Hey remember that feeling of unease that we gave you for an hour just now? Well here's another hour of the same thing, but stemming from terror and not from tragedy!" I swear there is a five-minute stretch of time where all that's happening is Peter waking up and walking down the hallway, but it was the most uncomfortable and upsetting five minutes of my life because of the terror underneath it all (and behind him...). And I never thought I would have my hairs all stand on end by seeing a naked smiling man standing in a doorway for seemingly no reason, but boy did _Hereditary_ present me with an opportunity to experience that!

Much to my surprise, the story becomes perfectly sensible in the end. One worry with movies like this is that half the scares come from things that don't really abide by the rules that the story eventually establishes. _Hereditary_ really leaves you until the very end wondering what the heck is going on, but the finale actually ties up all the little mysteries in a neat little way. The movie doesn't really treat itself as a mystery which actually enhances the mental payoff when things start clicking into place.

I think the movie is good, but it was such an emotional and physical journey that it's hard to say whether I "liked" it. A comparison comes to mind with A24 Productions' _The Witch_ which was also really discomforting throughout and had a foreboding and suffocating atmosphere to it. But with that movie there was a little more intrigue so during the downtime I was able to think to myself, "This is pretty interesting." With this movie there's very little time to analyze the plot because it's too busy slowly bashing you over the head with sorrow.

8/10
