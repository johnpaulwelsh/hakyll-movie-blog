A really freaky movie, especially given how old it is. I found myself sympathizing with Mark and also finding him very twisted, which means that his performance is great, but so is the writing. It's obviously trying to make a connection with the experience of watching a lurid horror movie.

After they found the second victim I predicted that he showed his victims a mirror, so it was nice to be proven right.

The encounter with the mother is really tense, that might be the best scene in the film.

I think this general plot was copied for _Manhunter_, the first Hannibal Lecter book, especially the inclusion of the blind woman and the romantic interest who hasn't caught on to the fact that her beau is a killer.

I like the music, especially when it's just sparse piano flourishes.

8/10
