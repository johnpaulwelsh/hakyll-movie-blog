About 60% cool and 40% corny or just weird for weird's sake. I think associating the word "feminist" with this film ahead of time taints the viewer's experience with it. I was trying to read everything as some kind of domestic hell or subservience to the man, but I don't know if I'd think those things if I didn't know that feminists like it so much. I wonder what someone would think if they were told this was directed by a man, when it really wasn't.

6/10
