A nice, healing kind of movie. Exactly the kind of thing that's a sure bet with my wife, because it's straightforward, pretty, gentle, and without a whole lot of subtext.

None of these frikkin adults know how to talk to a child, or talk politely when one is around. It makes me so thankful that my friends are good around my kid and around their own kids.

At the beginning, Cait is running away from everything. But at the end she's running toward something, first to the mailbox, but then back to Sean. And finally toward the car as it drives away. The fact that they don't subtitle the word "daddy" in the final scene is pretty powerful because it makes it ambiguous who she's referring to, her real dad coming up the drive or her adoptive dad who she's embracing.

8/10
