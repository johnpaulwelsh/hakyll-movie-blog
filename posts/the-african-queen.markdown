I liked it! Seeing Bogey in color was kind of shocking, especially because he starts out with a scruffy beard. It makes him look like an uneducated blue collar guy, not one of the biggest movie stars ever.

It seems ridiculous to hatch a scheme to blow up the German ship without much of a plan for getting rescued afterwards. But maybe I missed the details about how they thought they would get out of there.

Seeing Rosie pour out all the whiskey immediately made me think, "Why is the rum gone?"

There's nothing about the movie that elevates it beyond good old fashioned entertainment, but that's okay.

8/10
