The animation style is fascinating, but somehow they made the movie very boring despite that. The script has absolutely no subtlety. Setting it in the middle of the Vietnam War is the icing on the cake of bashing the audience over the head with the "American civilization bad, nature good" theme.

I watched this late at night and I was very tired, so that might have contributed to my lack of emotional investment.
