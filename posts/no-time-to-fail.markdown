Not a YouTube-style explainer about how elections work. Not a post-mortem about how the 2020 election went down. Just a good peek behind the curtain about how elections work in general, but especially in a stressful year like 2020, and especially in a state like Rhode Island. Informative and surprisingly engaging. The people all come across as really earnest and kind and normal. I especially liked the women who work in the office, their accents are horrendous but you feel like you know them from the local diner or from church.

8/10
