What an utterly ridiculous movie. John Travolta bursts into song with such drama and fervor that it made me laugh every single time.

I thikn at least one whole point of this score comes from Olivia Newton-John being super adorable, I enjoyed watching her the most out of all the cast. Stockhard Channing is really good too though, not that she's likeable, but she's great for the role.

I was kind of surprised to see how little plot there is in this movie, and especially how much of the non-songs part of the film are just teenagers being horny. This hardly counts as PG anymore.

It kind of feels like this movie presupposes familiarity with the songs because the staging and camera framing is super weird, for example a lot of plot occurs during "Hand Jive" so if you're watching it for the first time, it's kind of surprising to see the movie pay less attention to the dancing for a moment. Also the placement and movement of the camera is way less flashy than I expected, there are whole dance scenes where the camera doesn't move at all and it's zoomed far out so you can see everything. In a modern movie the camera would be all up in the dancers' faces and you wouldn't even be able to see the choreography.

9/10
