        <p>Absolutely brutal. I am so impressed with this movie, it just felt too real. I am so glad that I’m privileged enough to not have to experience this kind of lifestyle. Also it’s amazing to see how much of the local economy is just built off of scamming Disney tourists (like the names of the motels).</p>
<p>All the kids act like kids, but all the adults act like babies.</p>
<p>I knew going in that there would be a scene at the end within the gates of Disney World, because apparently they went in with an iPhone to get the footage without having to jump through Disney’s legal hoops. But holy crap, I didn’t realize it would be such a blunt and unforgiving ending.</p>
<p>The children are some of the cutest kids I’ve seen in a movie, which makes it even harder to watch.</p>
<p>Willem Dafoe plays a perfect older man who has dealt with a lot of human drama as manager of The Magic Castle. He has just the right balance of empathy and exasperation.</p>
<p>This movie is basically like, “hey you remember Jason’s stories about Jacksonville from <em>The Good Place</em>? Let’s show you what that’s really based off of.”</p>
<p>Seeing the kids playing was a really nostalgic experience, sort of like how I felt while watching <em>Eighth Grade</em>.</p>
<p>10/10</p>
