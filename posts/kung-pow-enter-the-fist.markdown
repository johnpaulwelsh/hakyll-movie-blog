Unbelievably stupid, of course, but most of it is my kind of stupid. The CGI implanting of Steve into the existing scenes is pretty well done most of the time. The CGI everywhere else is terrible, but kinda like intentionally so, so I still like it. The cow fight is just lame and I feel bad for anyone whose first memory of this movie is that scene.

My favorite part might be when Ling's dad appears and he does a man-voice version of her same weeooweeoo vocal tic. It still makes me laugh even after the movie ended.

Why does this work, I wonder? Let me try to think seriously about this dumb movie for a minute. It could be a bad YouTube video dub, if it didn't have new scenes and okay-level CGI. It could be mean-spirited if there were jokes about the culture of Asians or stereotypes on display, but honestly every character is a unique spin on comedic stock types. The incompetent youngster is actually trained badly on purpose. The indecisive love interest is totally bizarre and doesn't fit well into a specific trope. There are gay jokes but nobody is "the gay one." The voices are maybe the most "problematic" part, but the exaggerated ones are also kinda insane and detatched from the ethnicity of the characters.

So I guess what I'm saying is, _Kung Pow_ is really smart about exactly which stupid jokes to make.

8/10
