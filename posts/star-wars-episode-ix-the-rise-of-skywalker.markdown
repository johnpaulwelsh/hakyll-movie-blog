I think I will like this movie more when I see it a second time. With _The Last Jedi_, I needed to step away from the movie itself and view it from the mythical perspective to really decide if I liked the direction the movie was going, and I want to do the same with this one.

Lore whores will HATE this movie.

The "all of the Sith/Jedi are in me" thing is great, and I'm surprised it didn't come up earlier.

Kylo's character arc?

Palpatine's planet is the coolest thing in the whole new trilogy.

Leia doing Jedi training - a backwards fix for her crazy Force powers in _TLJ_? Maybe, but it makes sense and they did the Laura Palmer flashback technique which was really cool.

Lots of plot threads came out of nowhere, but who cares? When _TESB_ came out, Palpatine was pulled out of thin air. The only difference here is that 7, 8, and 9 were intended to be a trilogy, so I guess there's an expectation that the story will be unified and thought-out from the get-go.

No idea how much of Leia was CGI and how much was live action leftover footage, but the CGI was impressive enough where I could barely tell the difference obviously.

8/10
