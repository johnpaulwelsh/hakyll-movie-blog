        <p>I always heard two conflicting messages about this movie: that it is an important spiritual experience, and that it’s exploitative trash. Now that I’ve finally seen it for myself, I think it’s firmly in the former camp.</p>
<p>Never before have I seen a film that brought the human side of Christ so much to the forefront. This sure ain’t one of those gutless History Channel reenactments. But it also gives a faithful and rich portrayal of nearly every other character, whether it be the Virgin Mary, the Simon the Cyrinean, or Pontius Pilate.</p>
<p>The scourging at the pillar is brutal to be sure, but I think it would be a weaker film if they tamped down the violence. Mel Gibson clearly wanted the audience to feel disgusted and agonized by this scene, and I think it works. It’s not as if he shot the movie like it were a snuff film - there is a lot of artistic flair and realized vision that seems to be missing from all the “classic” Biblical movies. Nothing ever seems cheap or cheesy, and maybe that’s the biggest accomplishment the film could have had.</p>
