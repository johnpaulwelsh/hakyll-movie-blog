It's been a really long time since I've seen such an enigmatic movie, something that so strongly refuses to let you in on what's really going on, but still spends a lot of time making you feel a certain way about the events of the story.

The general idea seems to be "picture of a girl having a nervous breakdown," but clearly something else is going on between Cat and Virginia, these two so-called best friends. The whole time I was expecting it to be an unrequited love between them, because the onset of their anger and fighting seems to be tied to the presence of men during a "girls' weekend" kind of get-together. Although I think it's even deeper than that, because then how does the house party one year ago fit into the picture? Or the guy in the woods who Cat says she could murder without anyone knowing? Or that painting at the end?

I'm not sure about how I feel about the use of flashbacks in this film. Normally I don't like when a story hinges most of its tension on something that happened in the past that all the characters know about, but the audience dos not know about. But I think it all evens out in this movie because I barely even know what's happening in the present, too!

On more of a surface level, my impression is, "what a horrible group of young adults." Every time the film has a scene where Cat seems to sincerely be in pain and need of support, Virginia just ruins the mood by being a brat. And Cat really doesn't do herself any favors, seemingly every other scene she's the one attacking Virginia. You can almost feel the tension in the room whenever one of the other of these two young women starts talking with venom in her voice. And don't get me started on Rich.

All the acting is great, of course.

I really like the music and the ending credits.

I guess I really don't know what to make of this movie, but I was interested in what was happening as it was going along at least. You'd think I would be pissed off at a movie ending with no concrete resolution, but I guess I like it just fine in this one.

Maybe it's unfair to compare this to _Persona_ but my half-memory of that movie tells me that _Queen of Earth_ is a very similar setup. I remember not being able to make heads or tails of that one either.

7/10
