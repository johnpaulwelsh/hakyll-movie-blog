It's pretty good, and quite funny. I bet if I were a 15 year old girl and saw this, I would obsess over it for years.

The movie had the right amount of romantic tension for me to go along with it, and not to just roll my eyes at a premature love confession or something.

But there are a lot of nice little tie-ins to make the ending as happy as possible, like the revelation of who the guy's mom was.

There are a couple little things they didn't explain outright, which I bet are well established in the book. I'm mostly thinking of the opening scene about someone writing in to a scientist asking some question that the scientist dismisses. I assume it was the dad writing in after he came back from over the wall, but the movie never says. Also, I just had to guess that the star was dragged down to earth by the necklace as an accident, not because the necklace was specifically designed to lasso stars or something.

The CGI was kind of bad in places.

In fact I bet the book is a 10/10, you can just tell that every scene that's good in the movie, is probably amazing in the book.

Claire Danes is a wonder of the modern world, how can a person be that beautiful?

If I didn't know that Robert de Niro was in this movie I would have flipped out when he showed up. His character was great.

The peanut gallery of dead princes was one of the best touches of weirdness that makes the movie charming. I also liked that the witches slaughtered animals to read their entrails, and it's kinda gross when they do it. Also also, the fact that the goat-man still acted like a goat as a man was excellent.

8/10
