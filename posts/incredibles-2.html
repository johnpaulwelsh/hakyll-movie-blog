        <p><em>Incredibles 2</em> is definitely a fun movie and a fine superhero flick, but I’m disappointed because that’s basically all it is.</p>
<p>The plot is so predictable that it actually surprised me when the villain was revealed, because I expect so much more from Pixar by this point. One of the nicest surprises of <em>Coco</em> was that it packs legitimate surprises into the plot (at least from my perspective - I’m really good at being fooled by the apparent plot of a movie), but in the sequel to a superhero movie Pixar decides to go as obvious as possible? Disappointing.</p>
<p>As for thematic complexity, I saw a ray of hope during Screenslaver’s monologue while Elastigirl is leaping from building to building. It read to me as a brutal critique of modern blockbuster superhero films being a substitute for real-life excitement and meaning, and I was intrigued at the possibilities of how this could fit into the plot of the movie. To its credit, the film doesn’t try to fight against this argument, because honestly I think it would have been really cringey and I think it would have been taking up the losing side of the argument. But it doesn’t address the issue at all, which is a huge missed opportunity in my opinion. As it stands, the villain has an interesting worldview that is similar to Amon’s in season 1 of <em>The Legend of Korra</em>, but the heroes end up winning through completely conventional means without confronting the villain’s motivation any more than is strictly necessary.</p>
<p>The role of the man in the house, or of the woman in the workforce. Bob’s underlying insecurity of not being the guy in charge of the situation. The difficulty of parenting alone. All of these themes are touched upon in the movie, but almost nothing of substance comes of any of it aside from cute family moments.</p>
<p>That said, the entertainment value is pretty high despite the lackluster script. The potential of Jak-Jak’s powers that was built up at the end of the first movie is more than satisfied in this one. Edna Mode’s scenes are also a major highlight.</p>
<p>Pixar has been putting out two kinds of movies every since <em>Cars</em>: good popcorn flicks and great works of art. <em>Incredibles 2</em> is an almost perfect example of an average entry in the first camp. I personally don’t love the first <em>Incredibles</em> as much as some other people do, but I think in comparison to the sequel, its themes of family togetherness and struggle are much deeper and more artistic. I guess I just expected more after 14 years waiting for a sequel to one of Pixar’s most beloved 2000s movies.</p>
