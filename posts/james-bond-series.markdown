**1) _Dr. No_ (11.27.20)**

Kind of corny, but also pretty cool. Has that 1960s feel that makes it feel a bit boring and slow, but not really the fault of the movie itself.

The music is immediately iconic, and Sean Connery is quite a handsome man.

7/10

**2) _From Russia With Love_ (12.06.20)**

Better in almost every way than Dr. No. The espionage was more exciting and silly, the chases were more spectacular, the dialogue was funnier, and even the Bond Girl was sexier. The exotic locations weren't as impressive, but there was still a fair bit of eye-candy on that front.

Some parts are clearly unnecessary, like the gypsy clapper dance and the two girls catfighting. I don't hold it against it very much though.

8/10

**3) _Goldfinger_ (12.12.20)**

This one goes above and beyond the previous two, and it fully deserves its iconic status. Nearly every scene had me giggling with delight. This is pretty much everything I'd hope for a James Bond movie to be, and I honestly fear that I won't like any of the other Sean Connery films as much as this one.

The only conceivable complaint I could have is that the final fight with Oddjob is a little light on the drama, but that's easily made up for by the atomic bomb waiting to go off behind them the whole time.

10/10

**4) _Thunderball_ (12.13.20)**

There isn't as much gadgetry as compared to the previous entries, and there's something a little dull regarding Bond's interactions with the other characters (even the women, surprisingly). The underwater fighting is the real draw here, and overall it's pretty thrilling, even if some of the scenes feel a bit sluggish and bring down the pace of the story due to underwater action being floaty by definition.

Also what the heck happened to that nice guy who rescued Domino at the end? He jumped off the boat and just vanished.

7/10

**5) _You Only Live Twice_ (01.01.21)**

A big improvement over Thunderball, especially in terms of pacing and clarity of plot. The set pieces are spectacular and the gadgets are some of the funniest ones yet (shooting Bond out of a submarine missile hole, cigarette guns, and "Little Debbie"). Thank god they finally started using accurate foreign casts in this one.

9/10

**6) _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_ (01.16.21)**

Starts out a little dull, but slowly ramps up into one of the better movies so far in the series. The evil plan is ridiculous the way Goldfinger's was, and the action sequences are really spectacular. To be honest, the movie was nearly ruined by the needlessly cruel ending. Overall, Tracy is the best Bond girl so far, by being the most beautiful as well as the most competent.

Whoever was the editor for this movie was on drugs, there are so many random jumpy cuts that it seems like they were covering up mistakes.

8/10

**7) _Diamonds are Forever_ (01.20.21)**

I reacted to this one the same way I reacted to the fourth _Indiana Jones_ movie. It's totally ridiculous, and using one definition, it's sillier than a James Bond movie "should" be. However I think the only definition that matters is, was I entertained? In which case _Diamonds Are Forever_ is a great installment in the franchise.

The plot almost moved too fast, given how many insane things they're able to cram in. And the Bond Girl this time around was a little too derpy, not as empowered or campy as the others have been. But otherwise it was a damn fun time.

I especially enjoyed the car chase in Vegas, scaling the casino facade, and the absolutely idiotic dialogue they got some of these American actors to recite.

8/10
