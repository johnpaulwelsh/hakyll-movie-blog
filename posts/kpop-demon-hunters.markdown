I don't wanna be too hard on it because when it's good it's really quite good. But let me begin with the negatives because they are very prominent.

The animation is a really unappealing combination of ultra-polished CG, stop-motion, and the aesthetic of smooth little plastic pachinko toys.

The opening 15 mins or so it is pretty hard to stomach because the editing is way too hyperactive and the writing is cramped. I think if they made the opening a little longer and less of an anime sizzle reel, and more of a proper introduction to the lore and the characters, it'd feel more like a worthy piece of original IP and less like an abandoned movie tie-in with something else. Like who is Celine? And how exactly does a demon father a child? Btw that reminds me of Shion from _Higurashi_ which is always nice.

The lyrics too... They work fine as pop song lyrics, but as movie musical lyrics they're far too on-the-nose. If these were all needle-drops instead of original songs, it would feel like "Seven Nation Army" on top of _Suicide Squad_ or something equally cringey.

But the good now! The message of the movie is really excellent. The use of shame as a tool for controlling the demon army is unique and intriguing. Some of the things that they said during the secret meetings at night were really insightful (also Kylo-Rey vibes which I appreciated).

And the songs... Good! Golden is a worthy hit pop song. The boy band being evil is very funny because it helps show the bad side of pop idol fandom in a friendly way. The comedy is very well tuned too, though seeing typical 2D anime facial expressions on 3D models made me think I was looking at those horrendous Labubu dolls.

"Once More With Feeling" is the single most obvious predecessor to this.

7/10
