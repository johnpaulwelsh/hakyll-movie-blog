Rewatching with my wife, so I was almost able to see the movie through a first-timer's eyes, in addition to knowing the twist that was coming the whole time. I thought the movie was more mind-blowing when I was a teenager (no surprise there), but I think it still holds up. One of the best parts of the script is that the mystery of "who is Keyser Soze" isn't introduced for at least 20 minutes. It would be much hokier if the first scene was some guy whispering "Keyser... Soze..." and then dying, or some ham-handed such nonsense. But the movie makes its case for being compelling even before the Soze mystery is introduced, because the actors sell their characters so well.

Also talk about a movie that's not okay to watch in a post-#MeToo world. Directed by Bryan Singer, and starring Kevin Spacey? I'm surprised there isn't a tell-all New York Times piece alleging a child-porn ring in the background of this movie set.

8/10

=============

Another rewatch, man this movie is boring when you know what the ending is. I don't care at all about any of these characters. But I also didn't feel motivation to piece together what were lies and what were truth, I just didn't care. I guess Verbal only had to lie enough to establish that Keaton was the mastermind, because he knew the cop wanted that to be the answer. But it really does feel like you can't trust anything he says in light of the twist, even though logically there must be some things that are true (they go to LA, they take a job that involves going near a docked ship, etc.). The ending is still pretty exciting but overall this movie is dropping in my estimation quite fast, like _The Shining_ did.

5/10
