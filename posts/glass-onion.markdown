So fun, so glad I watched this in a theater. I think it's safe to say now that Rian Johnson's murder mysteries are also social commentaries on the rubes and corrupted individuals of our era. In Knives Out it was more obvious and probably more inflammatory, in the sense that the golden-hearted immigrant beats all the bastard rich white people in the end. But in this one it's a wider net and a more agreeable conclusion - rich business geniuses can be vain and selfish liars, and it's important to expose the truth for the good of our society but also for the good of individuals people's lives.

Daniel Craig is out-bad-accent'ed by Janelle Monae by a long shot, which honestly is kind of great in its own way.

The mystery reveal in *Knives Out* felt like a weird cop-out but it at least was redeemed by a clever double-misdirect. In this it's much more straightforward but actually I think it's more fun to watch the deduction process and the back story process as a result of its relative simplicity.

I much prefer "genius mole while drunk" over "vomits when lies" as an endearing character trait of the girl sidekick.

I feel like this one won't have as much rewatch power compared to the first one. Not because of "I have to see everything again now that I know the solution" but actually the opposite - watching the characters and plot developments in general might not be as much fun for this one once the "I don't know how this is going to end" has worn off.

The performances are all great. The visual are stunning too: it all looks so real except the car crashing through the ceiling at the end.

9/10
