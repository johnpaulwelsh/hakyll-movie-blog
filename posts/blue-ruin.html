        <p>Blue Ruin is a really a good movie, even though on paper it’s just okay. I could accuse the story of being nothing special, but the execution is so damn good that it makes up for any theoretical shortcomings. It’s the kind of movie that’s really excellent while watching, but doesn’t really give much to ponder afterward and probably won’t end up being “memorable” in my mind. Still, it’s an impressive work.</p>
