Marion's story at the beginning is kind of boring. Once she gets to the motel the movie noticeably becomes more invested in its own story.

Anthony Perkins gives an amazing performance. Everything he says and all his physical mannerisms seem taken out of a different universe, he comes across with the honesty of a bit-part in a noir film but he ends up carrying the entire film.

The movie isn't scary in the least for an adult audience who already knows what's going to happen, and at this point who doesn't know what's going to happen in _Psycho_? The creepiest part of the movie is Norman's calm disposal of Marion's body, and the fact that you hear the mother's voice multiple times. I had forgotten how much of the movie tries to convince you that Norman's mother is really still alive, since it's common knowledge now that Norman himself is the Psycho.

The explanation of Norman's condition at the end is kind of heavy-handed, I think they could have cut half the lines and gotten across the general point, but while maintaining some level of mystery and intrigue about it.

The music is classic, of course.

6/10
