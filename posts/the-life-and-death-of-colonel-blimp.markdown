A pretty weird experience, where I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film but I can't figure out what the point or meaning is. It's clearly an epic (not just in length but in scope), and it's clearly meant to get me to care about dear old Candy by the end (which I definitely do), but usually an epic is setting a personal story against a backdrop of history, and I think that part of it just doesn't quite reach it. You could say the theme of the movie is how war has evolved over the course of Candy's life, and it may have left Candy behind in his noble and honorable ways. But there isn't enough of a delivery of that theme in the end, because he gives in and accepts his place as a retiree rather than fighting nobly but ineffectually against it. I guess I want to listen to some commentary or reviews on this to see what makes the story justify its gigantic scope, or at least what was the intent.

The whole thing about Candy being surrounded at all times by women who look like his first true love, could have come across as creepy (especially in light of a movie like _Vertigo_) but I think it just barely misses that level.

To reiterate, I really liked it. I think this is a pure movie in the sense that enjoyment comes from the pleasures of the sets, costumes, writing, acting, and music, and not really the meaning or weight of the story. I could not easily recommend this film to others because I could only say that it's enjoyable to watch, not that it's "interesting" or "impressive." I guess in some senses this proves I'm a cinephile, because I'd gladly watch this again just to see the colors (especially Technicolor red), to laugh at the scene in the German cafe, to admire the beauty of the women, to stare at that ridiculous mustache.

It's pretty remarkable that I didn't realize Deborah Kerr played all four young women! I'm a total idiot, or else they did an amazing job of changing her dress and makeup to embody different people.

I really like the way the film uses hunting trophies to show time passing, while also showing you the emotional state of Candy during that time (he's occupied by hunting as a distraction from his lovesickness).

I'm still confused who Colonel Blimp is. I guess I'll need to look up the history of this whole thing.

NOTE: I've now learned who Colonel Blimp is. I think in modern times it would be a lot less confusing to have an alternate title that doesn't mention death and calls the character by his real name. Or a totally different title.

8/10
