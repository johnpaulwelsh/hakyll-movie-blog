Similar to _Dial M for Murder_, you can definitely tell this started as a play. But unlike that movie, there are quite a lot of movie tricks in this one which elevate its artistry. I was especially impressed with the shot where Mrs. Wilson is clearing the table, where we linger on her work while listening to the rest of the guests talk about where oh where could David be. I also love the part where Jimmy Stewart walks through how he'd kidnap David, and we see the camera follow his narrative to the door, the piano, the drinks table, the chair. That can't be done in books or plays, it's a very filmic technique. Honestly it would only work in a sound film too. Hitchcock started in silent films and this demonstrates he learned the medium of talkies to its fullest extent.

Needless to say the performances and story are excellent too. A classic if I've ever seen one.

The bonus documentary on the dvd actually blew my mind. Everything the screenwriter says rings true for me and I can't unhear it, how it's all about gay men, how Jimmy Stewart has no sexual chemistry with the boys so that element is lost and it could have been maintained with a different actor, how there's a missing element of ambiguity because the film depicts the murder instead of leaving it off-screen.

Unfortunately the transitions between reels are super obvious and distracting (except for one or two).

10/10
