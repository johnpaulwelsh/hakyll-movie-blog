Pretty cute and funny most of the way through. I wasn't as much of a fan with the Madonna scenes or Escobar scenes, the former probably because I was threatened by how sexual she was, and the latter because it dragged the pacing down a lot and didn't provide many laughs until after Al kills Escobar.

The direct parallels / parodies, no surprise, were my favorite. Like the Jim Morrison "whip it out" scene or the reference to Carrie at the very end. The whole movie leading up to the pool party at Dr. Demento's was also excellent.

I liked in retrospect how much they committed to an 80s-centric alternate history of Weird Al, even when it didn't make sense. Like they didn't try to even explain why Amish Paradise was written in 1985 as opposed to 1995 or whenever Coolio's original song came out.

The cameos were fun. Daniel Radcliffe was doing a spot-on Weird Al impression the whole time. The way he delivered jokes was exactly the way Al acts.

They very cleverly dodged having to talk too much about Michael Jackson in a honest way, I'm sure it made the Jackson estate happy that they didn't have to reckon with his pedophilia at all.

It's funny that they basically wrote a stereotypical rock star biopic but put real people from Al's sphere of influence into the stock character roles. Madonna being his manipulative girlfriend isn't making any commentary at all about Madonna herself. And same goes for Dr. Demento. I'm not sure how well it worked but it's at least committed to the bit.

7/10
