This is kind of a fantastic adaptation of a book which defies adaptation. I read the book in the summer of 2014 and it was challenging, but also very rewarding. I was suspicious about a movie version because I thought it would only cover the main mystery plot and leave out the intellectual elements that the book so prominently featured. I was pleasantly surprised by how smart and expansive the script for the movie ended up being.

Somehow the film clarifies the themes of the book by taking out many of the complex and esoteric elements, but leaving most of the subplots and making them all work together to form a unified vision for the story. The murders, the heresy accusations, and the general dysfunction in the monastery, all have to do with authoritarian leaders displaying an erosion of trust towards their underlings. Or something like that.

The attitude towards all the barbaric practices at first seemed kind of exploitative, but then I remembered that the book wasn't exactly singing the praises of those themes either. I feel bad for anyone who goes into this movie without at least some respect for the history of religious life in Europe, because they might read too much into the really offensive anti-woman stuff and miss the larger points the movie is trying to make. Remember, the script wasn't written in the 1200s, so the movie is perfectly aware that the characters say a lot of outrageous and hard-nosed things.

The mystery itself was well executed and the non-mystery scenes came together to make the whole movie mean something other than just the mystery. I love that they kept it focused on the long-lost book by Aristotle and didn't dumb it down for movie audiences.

Other thoughts:
- Wow surprise explicit sex scene! That was a little awkward to watch
- Wow every actor is horrifyingly ugly! The hairdos are beyond awful and the transformation they made to Ron Perlman is both miraculous and diabolical
- Sean Connery is an absolute delight through the whole film

8/10
