This is kind of a fantastic adaptation of a book which I had thought defies adaptation. I read the book in the summer of 2014 and it was very challenging, but also very rewarding. I was suspicious about a movie version because I thought it would only cover the main mystery plot and leave out the intellectual elements that the book so prominently featured, but I was pleasantly surprised by how smart and expansive the movie ended up being.

Somehow the film actually clarifies the themes of the book by taking out many of the complex and esoteric elements, but leaving most of the subplots and making them all work together to form a unified vision for the story. The murders, the heresy accusations, and the general dysfunction in the monastery, all have to do with authoritarian leaders displaying an erosion of trust towards their underlings, or something like that. All I know is that when the film is cutting between William and Adso running around the library and the Inquisition getting ready to burn the heretics, I could sense that they were really two sides of the same story. Things work together and connect in ways that you can only get away with in a book or a super artsy-fartsy movie, but it's also pretty approachable as a historical mystery film on its own.

The attitude towards all the barbaric practices and mentalities at first seemed kind of exploitative (Talking about the Virgin Mary's breast? C'mon man that's just weird), but then I remembered that the book wasn't exactly making excuses for those elements. I feel bad for anyone who goes into this movie without at least some appreciation or understanding of the history of religious life in Europe, because they might read too much into the really offensive anti-woman stuff and miss the larger points the movie is trying to make. Remember, the script wasn't written in the 1200s, so the movie is perfectly aware that the characters say a lot of outrageous things.

The mystery itself was well-executed too. I love that they kept it focused on that long-lost book by Aristotle and didn't dumb it down for movie audiences. I do think the "Aha, William explains all!" scenes were a little on-the-nose, but I can't deny they amped up the excitement.

Other thoughts:
- Wow surprise explicit sex scene! That was a little awkward to watch
- Wow every actor is horrifyingly ugly! The hairdos are beyond awful and the transformation they made to Ron Perlman is both miraculous and diabolical
- Sean Connery is an absolute delight through the whole film

8/10
