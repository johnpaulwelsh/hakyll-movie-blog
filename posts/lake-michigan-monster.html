        <p>Simply amazing. Creative, surprising, and very very funny. I wanted to watch this again the minute it ended. It comes across as the best low-budget student film ever, or maybe the best YouTube skit, but it definitely has enough weight that it feels like a film and not an extra-good video.</p>
<p>“Oh this is a phantom ship” is the funniest line delivery I’ve seen in years.</p>
