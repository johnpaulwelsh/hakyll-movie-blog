Dumb but fun. Exciting when it needed to be, goofy minion robots, pretty awesome gross body horror stuff. There might be some symbolism in the fact that the captain's head got grafted onto a body with a red star tattoo, some kind of US-USSR axis of evil or something. But honestly this movie becomes much less good the more I try to think about it in a smart way, because it reminds me too much of _The Abyss_ (which is such a better movie it's hard to even compare them on quality). "Man is virus" is the level of subtlety this movie goes for, and it's better to not think more deeply than that.

While reading the credits I learned this is based on a comic book series, and honestly now everything makes sense! It's silly and focused mostly on being cool, which is just like comic books.

I admire the commitment to practical robot effects for most of the movie (except the big bad one at the end). The little robot gremlins are funny but would be much less entertaining as CGI creatures.

6/10
