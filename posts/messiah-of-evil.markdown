I liked this, but I don't know why. Maybe the colors, the mood, the long stretches of silence, and the undeniable creep factor. I wonder if I had seen this without any prior reputation in my head, if I would find it dull and nonsensical. But I can't worry about what-ifs. I did enjoy this, it was really creepy and moody and cool. The dark stranger reminds me of Randall Flagg, and a little bit of Leviathan (thanks Lord of Spirits). It has a slow burn element which feels pretty foreign to American films from the early 70s, much more like a modern indie flick or a European movie. The brief exanation given for why the stranger came back after 100 years, something about a new age which looks backwards to the old ways, that struck a chord with me. Pagan ways never die, we can only fight them back with the light of Christ.

The movie theater scene is one of my favorite sequences. This blaring horrendous preview for a western movie keeps playing and the town folk just file in and sit down. It feels like it's commenting on something about American entertainment culture, but I'm not interested in analyzing it too much.

8/10
