The idea of Batman in such a slick real-world setting is really silly, until you actually see Gotham at the 45 minute mark and realize that it's a total goofball comic-book city, not a gritty realistic one. So it ends up working out.

Unfortunately it's still a comic book movie, which means the philosophy is kind of childlike and silly. The League of Shadows especially is pretty stupid because the rest of the movie surrounding it is being super-serious realistic, but here's a group of dudes in the snow who train as ninjas that intentionally destroy civilizations to keep them from becoming too decadent. Likewise, the progression of Bruce going from angsty twentysomething to Batman is far-fetched, his motivation to change is pretty convenient and vague and I would have much rather they skipped the origin story altogether.

I like the high stakes, Scarecrow doesn't feel like a comic-book villain and the plot against Gotham is actually scary. I'm actually surprised how low key some characters are, like Gordon is more anonymous than I expected him to be considering even I, a non-comic-book-nerd, knew who Gordon was before watching any Batman movies.

It must have been really cool to see a good Batman movie again after so many years, back in 2005. The part that solidified it for me was the car chase with Rachel as a passenger, it was like the movie flipped a switch called "this is special," sort of like how you know even the very first time watching _Back to the Future_ that the clock tower race is something special.

Rachel always has this cute-but-smug lip curl thing going, I've probably never seen her in anything before now. And I'm pretty impressed how seamlessly they replaced her with Maggie Gyllenhaal in the next one, they both have a similar look.

Christian Bale always has his lips hanging open, Rachel should have known who Batman was on first glance.

The editing in the fistfight scenes is honestly some of the worst I've ever seen. It doesn't even look like a fight, it's just really quick shots of people leaning on each other in awkward positions to give the illusion of movement.

7/10
