        <p>Going in to this second <em>Cloverfield</em> installment, I was fearful that the first movie’s brilliance was mostly a fluke, and that <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> would just be a passable thriller with not too much to say. I was more or less right, but I still enjoyed the movie.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint is that the tone of this movie is all over the place. Most of it feels like a mystery/thriller, with a lot of back-and-forth about whether Howard can be trusted. For a while I bought into it, because the evidence for and against his telling the truth fluctuates in a believable way that legitimately kept me guessing.</p>
<p>But after a while, I think the movie tries to put in a bunch of other elements just to make sure that core mystery can last about 90 minutes. Sometimes this means amping up the excitement when an “action” scene was coming up, which could probably work better in isolation or in a different movie altogether. I was becoming suspicious of this kind of amp-up tactic even during a scene at the beginning of the film, namely when Michelle is turning her crutch into a spear. I mean, she <em>obviously</em> isn’t going to succeed, so it feels a little cheap to put some dramatic music behind her little wood-carving montage. In a movie more focused on the drama of how these people interact in the bunker, this scene probably wouldn’t have happened at all.</p>
<p>Other times the film injects a scene that is simultaneously lighthearted and twisted, like the first time they have dinner or the game of Taboo that they play together. The mood that these scenes cast are very reminiscent of Tim Burton in my opinion, and his particular style of zany dark humor, but in the context of the movie it feels a little out of place. Any maybe this is me just being unfair, but I get the feeling that kind of thing is bound to happen in a PG-13 thriller movie, adding in scenes that make attempts at humor but just end up feeling awkward. Side note, the PG-13 rating probably also explains why there isn’t a whiff of sexual tension in the whole story.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, I don’t want the movie to be something it isn’t. Making it only about how three people survive in the event of a catastrophe would take most of the charm away from the story. And if the film were a full-on mystery it would be hard to justify the movie’s length without adding some more meat to the mystery.</p>
<p>As for positives, I think the acting is great. In particular, John Goodman reveals a lot of depth in his character without coming across too much like a caricature. Like I alluded to earlier, the back-and-forth over whether to trust Howard’s claims about what has happened outside the bunker was fun to experience. Also, the music was very fairytale-esque and sometimes it was so bombastic and high-gloss that I lost focus on the visuals and just enjoyed listening to the score. it’s not that the music messed up any of the scenes it was on top of, but it definitely helped contribute to the not-quite-dead-serious tone of the whole movie. Which in the end is a plus for the movie, since that’s clearly what they were going for.</p>
<p>I also need to praise the film for pulling an “it was aliens the whole time!” kind of ending. I actually <em>love</em> when the twist ending has to do with aliens, even though I’ll readily admit that it comes off as cheesy or lame. I think it worked pretty well in this movie, because it takes up a sizeable-enough chunk of the ending that it doesn’t feel like a lazy afterthought. And truth be told, it’s exciting! I was more stressed out when Michelle left the bunker than at any point while she was in it. Also in this instance, we already kind of knew that aliens would be involved because of the events of the first <em>Cloverfield</em>, so it comes off as a lot less cheap that way.</p>
<p>I know it doesn’t sound like I enjoyed the movie, but let me assure you I did. I just can’t help but be harsh on it in comparison to its predecessor. I loved <em>Cloverfield</em> precisely because it wasn’t lazy or awkward, so I feel the need to call out <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> when it falls for those easy traps.</p>
<p>As for predictions for <em>The Cloverfield Paradox</em>? I’m guessing it will be a 6/10 from me. I think it might be the most boring entry of the trilogy, but if it fits really snugly into the existing lore and has some juicy reveals, then it will win major brownie points from me.</p>
