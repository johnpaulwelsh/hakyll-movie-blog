When I first saw this I rated it a 10. I think it was because there was a critical mass of "haha what the heck" scenes, and as a teenager I just loved it. Now as a more sober early-30s man, I don't think it's quite as exciting, but I still do like the movie quite a bit.

Maybe my tune will change after I read or watch the bonus features on my Criterion Blu-Ray, but right now I feel like the movie was made just for the sake of being fun, but not silly. Maybe there's some broader lifestyle point being made by the whole thing, but on the surface it's a group of lowlifes who intersect with bumbling government UFO hunters, jerks, scumbags, and goofballs. And I like it just the way it is, as a showcase for all of those things.

The background details are really fun, like the super-generic product names like "Food" or "Beer".

I really like how cheap the special effects are, they don't feel amateurish, they just feel cheap as in low-in-dollars. Especially the armored truck with the blinking lights and spy monitors, it's just so goofy.

8/10
