Talk about a grower. This starts out like a less compelling version of _Wild Strawberries_, and ends up almost as absurd and likeable as _Smiles on a Summer Night_. I think the unevenness of the tone works against the movie a bit, but overall I found myself enjoying it quite a bit by the end. Especially when I think of the last 15 minutes compared to the first 15 minutes, they feel like completely different movies in a not-so-good way.

For a while, the alternating flashback-current scenes reminded me of _Dancer in the Dark_, in the sense that the flashbacks become more and more happy while the current-day scenes become more and more depressing. But then sometime on the train to Copenhagen that dynamic stopped, and everything became goofy and "comedic" in the classical sense.

I'm starting to think that "characters speaking frankly about their views on the world, humanity, love, etc." is going to be very hit-or-miss with me. Sometimes it works and sometimes it's annoying, and often it alternates within the same film. Maybe later Bergman is more straight-drama and features more plausible character traits. But I guess I will find out next time, when I watch the TV version of _Scenes from a Marriage_.

7/10
