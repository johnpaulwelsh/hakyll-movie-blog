I'm going to count this one, but Juniper has become obsessed with this movie so I've seen bits and pieces over the last three months more times than I can count.

There's actually not much time spent between Simba leaving and coming back in terms of screen time. It's maybe eight minutes of songs, and then another 10 minutes of plot, before he decides "okay I will go back and fight Scar." Leaving a large chunk of the movie hanging around little Simba before Mufasa dies.

But who cares? This movie is so fun and pretty and enjoyable. "Be Prepared" is probably my favorite song and visual segment of the movie, it's just perfect. The score is even better than the lyrical songs. The music that plays when Simba is returning home is just so beautiful I want to cry.

The stark red words on a black background with the big "boom" sound when the title shows up at the beginning and then end, that's \*chef's kiss\*.

9/10
