        <p>Pretty great, just like everyone said it was.</p>
<p>The story works as a stage musical because it has a lot of human drama, and wonderful themes and recurring ideas can be extracted from it. I expected more of a political nerd-fest snuck into a musical, but it’s really just a dramatic musical about a political person’s life, and it works great.</p>
<p>Lin Manuel-Miranda’s voice is probably the only non-stellar thing about it.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
