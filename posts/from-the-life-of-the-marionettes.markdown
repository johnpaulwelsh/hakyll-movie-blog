Simultaneously pretty interesting, but also the best example so far of what I think is Bergman's worst impulse, which is to have people behave horribly to each other in a relationship and pontificate about it in long monologues but without any real commitment to trying to justify or explain that behavior. This is best shown in the scene that begins with Peter trying to kill himself. The dialogue is so fake-dramatic and antisocial that it feels like a parody. But the rest of the movie feels much more sincere so that one scene gives a bad taste to the whole thing.

On the other hand, some moments are really insightful and interesting. The way Katarina tells the doctor that she loves her husband and that he's part of her in a permanent and physical way, that felt really legit and made me reflect on my marriage to my wife. And the conversation with the gay guy feels really honest too, his character is probably the best-realized in this movie.

The psychiatrist's conclusion at the end is a joke too. Latent homosexuality? Dominant mother? Social circle which encourages drugs and alcohol as a mask for emotional outbursts? He wouldn't have done anything rash if he hadn't met the prostitute? Doesn't he remember the suicide attempt? I actually think you're supposed to doubt this conclusion because the psychiatrist doesn't really prove himself to be trustworthy or insightful throughout the film. But in that case, what's the point of ending the story with a bad diagnosis?

In conclusion about the story, it's interesting at a surface level, but when reflecting on the purpose of the story I can't help but think that it's either a noncommittal attempt at making something edgy about failed relationships, or else it comes honestly from a really cynical and antisocial mind, which I can't relate to at all.

The shock of color at the beginning and end left a big impact, I must say, since all of the Bergman films I've seen so far are exclusively black and white. I wonder if I'd have felt this way if I had seen _Scenes from a Marriage_ and _Saraband_ before this, by following the festival order of the Blu-ray set.

Seeing this movie makes me want to rewatch _Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_ to see if it holds up. If you want to display a toxic marriage, go all out.

6/10
