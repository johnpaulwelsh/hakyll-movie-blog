I like this more than I probably should. I have very fond memories from my childhood of watching it, I might have seen it even more than _Mary Poppins_. The comparison between them is unfair by the way, this movie isn't just a worse _Mary Poppins_.

The children are hilarious, I don't remember them being so cheeky. The songs are catchy but some of them are admittedly a little weak.

9/10
