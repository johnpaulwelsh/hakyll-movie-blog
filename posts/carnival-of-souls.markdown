Things I liked:

* The opening credits were more interesting than they had the right to be.

* The music is rock solid. I especially like that you can't always tell if the organ music is diegetic or not, and sometimes it even seems to blend from one to the other in the middle of a scene.

* The overall atmosphere is really nice, enhanced by the music and the awesome cinematography.

* The segment of the movie after she gets fired, up until she gets to the car garage, is super depressing. I especially liked the part where she was in the bar with the neighbor, it almost felt like the movie was no longer about anything spooky and became more about a woman unsure of herself.

* The idea of people not being able to see or hear her is really interesting, and nicely pulled off in most scenes.

* The carnival itself is super creepy. It really feels like an abandoned place out there somewhere (and it probably is, or was).

* I think the core of the story has to do with this woman's personality. She doesn't seem to know what she wants, being alone vs. having company, and I think there's probably a lot of imagery and symbolism related to that.

Things I didn't like:

* Some of the technical aspects, and especially the foley work, was abysmal. The footsteps specifically are laughable.

* The parts where she was running around outside not being able to be seen or heard, went on for about a minute too long.

* The ending could have been a lot more brave and compelling, if they pulled the car out of the river and she was the only body not in it. Instead of being genuinely creepy, the story becomes just a dark version of the old _Owl Creek Ridge_ twist. I know it's an old movie so it's not likely to surprise someone with a modern sensibility, but I think it would have been a better ending anyway.

I think somewhere in here, there's a real psychological statement to be made about the state of mind of a lonely woman who's not connected to anybody or anything.

7/10
