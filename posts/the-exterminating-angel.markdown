What an extraordinary movie.

I had at one time read the IMDb one-sentence summary but had forgotten it by the time I rented the DVD from the library, so I went into the film more or less completely blind, and I'm so glad I did. As much as it might be a hard sell for most viewers, I think the best way to watch the movie is with no background information at all.

I love it when a crazy plot concept is carried along to its farthest logical conclusion, and I believe that's the case with this movie. The amount of great scenes that are squeezed out of such a narrow set of constraints is amazing to me. Even when the drama gets kicked up to 11 and the survival aspect of the plot gets really intense, the ridiculousness of the underlying premise keeps things nicely on the "black comedy" side of the fence.

There were definitely some parts that dragged a little, and I think overall the movie could have been about 10 minutes shorter without losing any of the punch. Also, it was certainly hard at times to keep track of so many characters and how they related to the other people (made harder by the film being in a foreign language).

Before now I only had experience with David Lynch's particularly American blend of surrealism, and I was worried that Luis Buñuel's surrealism would be too artsy, or too obscurely satirical, or too "random" to work with me. I'm very happy to say I was wrong - if Buñuel's other films are as fully-realized as _The Exterminating Angel_ is, then he might become one of my new favorite directors.

9/10
