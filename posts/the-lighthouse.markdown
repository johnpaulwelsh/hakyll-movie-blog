I think this movie wants to be a creepy and ambiguous art film, but the actual story feels more like a conventional "he's going crazy" story, which makes me way less interested in parsing the ambiguity and symbolism. Overall I enjoyed the film, but I think it didn't inspire me to reflect as much as it wanted to.

Actually if I had to compare it to something, the first thing that comes to mind is _Eraserhead_. That movie also has a lot of disturbing imagery, expressive black-and-white photography, droning and mechanical sound effects, and a vaguely sexual undercurrent. But I think _Eraserhead_ inspires more emotion and wonder than _The Lighthouse_ does, maybe because even the typical events are evocative of a greater theme. Whereas this movie seems to be a normal-ish survival drama with some weird stuff thrown in to spice it up.

I can't believe the 4:3 ratio was a good idea, but for the overall claustrophobic effect it works wonders.

Willem Dafoe as a crusty old sailor man is perfect.

7/10
