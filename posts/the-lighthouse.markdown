I think this movie wants to be a creepy and ambiguous art film, but the actual story feels more like a conventional "he's going crazy" story, which makes me way less interested in parsing the ambiguity and symbolism. Overall I enjoyed the film, but I think it didn't inspire me to reflect as much as it wanted to.

Actually if I had to compare it to something, the first thing that comes to mind is _Eraserhead_. That movie also has a lot of disturbing imagery, expressive black-and-white photography, droning and mechanical sound effects, and a vaguely sexual undercurrent. But I think _Eraserhead_ inspires more emotion and wonder than _The Lighthouse_ does, maybe because even the typical events are evocative of a greater theme. Whereas this movie seems to be a normal-ish survival drama with some weird stuff thrown in to spice it up.

I can't believe the 4:3 ratio was a good idea, but for the overall claustrophobic effect it works wonders.

Willem Dafoe as a crusty old sailor man is perfect.

I watched this again on 2023-07-15 and I liked it more, although at the beginning I thought I was going to be bored out of my mind on a rewatch. It took until one of the dinner scenes for me to regain my interest in the movie, and overall I ended up liking it better than the first time.

I think looking at the movie as "he goes crazy, the end" is missing the point of much of the imagery and dialogue. Early on I started thinking of these men as monks in a monastery, and I don't think it quite worked as a metaphor, but I definitely saw things differently under that mantle compared to when I just saw the events at their face value. For example, I noticed more often whenever a supernatural being is invoked, usually when Thomas is waxing poetic in anger or sorrow in those two scenes where he has a monologue like that. And I thought a lot about what the light actually is for Ephraim/Tommy. Is it actually something he thinks is worth experiencing, or is he just looking for something to provide answers for the abusive relationship he has with Thomas? What does the movie mean if the light is God, and one monk won't let the other monk see it? What does the movie mean if everything freaky that Tommy sees is real? What if none of it is?

This time around I also thought a lot about the kind of hopeless lonely work that being a logger or a wickie seems to be. I found that angle to be very provocative, how presumably people tend lighthouses for the money, but neither of these men seem to have goals or plans for their lives once they have the money. I don't think it's a mistake that every discussion about pay evokes a bitter laugh from the viewer, as if to say "that clearly doesn't matter, have you looked around you?"

The "dudes just being bros" angle is actually really obvious now that I've been primed to see it. This movie is really funny in the middle third. "You liked my lobster" is an all-time great line.

The shot of Thomas getting buried in dirt is so beautiful. It could be a kickass poster or book jacket for some other property and it would be immediately interesting.
