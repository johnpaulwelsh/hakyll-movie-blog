This movie starts out thinking it's clever, but then it ends up just really unsubtle and silly. It doesn't really survive past the twists when you think about it as a whole, and watching it a second time would almost certainly confirm for me that the movie overall is kinda meh.

Everything leading up to the first twist feels pretty solid. The acting is good, the sense of mystery is there, the gross-out factor wasn't too bad (I don't like vomit), and I really didn't know where it was going next because I thought the movie was gonna be about musical obsessives, sort of like _Black Swan_. If anything, I was bracing myself for the movie to become disappointing because it ended up being the same exact premise as _Higurashi_ (bus ride the Asian countryside, parasites in the brain and crawling under the skin, and a bucher's cleaver? Puh-LEASE).

After the first twist, and leading up to the second one, the movie feels a bit confused about who it wants the protagonist to be. After the second twist it makes sense why it felt that way (because they were trying to misdirect you), but it doesn't remove the feeling that the plot got out from under the filmmakers for a couple minutes.

As for the final revelation, I would have much rather preferred if Anton and his cronies were part of some kind of monster-worshiping cult, instead of just gross child abusers. I wouldn't have minded as much the theme of "music teachers abusive" if there was some kind of symbolism or interpretive layer to it, but it was really just a realistic (if still horrifying) version of that.

And oh my goodness, when the girls make a record-scratch and turn on the rap music when they're about to get Anton, I almost facepalmed from how cringe it was. And oh my GOODNESS, they "to the pain-ed" the guy! Come up with something less dorky!

When you think about it, all the actual horror elements in this movie are fake. There's no viral infection, no creepy cult, and no psychopathic jealous ex-cellist. It's just two women getting revenge.

In the end, I can't help but shake the feeling that the movie is one big "you go girl." It seems to be told from the perspective of someone inside the professional music industry, but the writing makes it clear that the writer is an outsider. There's no art to the message at all, just "domineering music teachers bad," almost as if I tried to come up with a cliched version of that idea as a challenge. So I can't help but feeling that the characters go lesbo just to emphasize the fact that men took advantage of them and so they reject the masculine. I don't feel personally threatened by that or anything, I just think it's one more eyeroll-worthy aspect to this movie.

5/10
