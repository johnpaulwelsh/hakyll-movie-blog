        <p>Typically bland 80s anime, with some “quality” voice acting (the shark guard is hilarious) and no real focus on the story. Some plotlines come and go haphazardly, for example they never have an audience with the princess until the fireworks conversation. And Bobby’s parents just up and disappear! How is that okay for a kids show/movie to just strand this little kid on an island and never have anything about how he misses them or wants to find them?</p>
<p>The songs were absolutely the best part, because they were so abrupt and silly at times. The Captain Smudge sea-shanty and the “this is a mighty fine hole” ditty made me laugh out loud.</p>
