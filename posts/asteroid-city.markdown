I liked it, but I think my emotional connection with the movie is almost entirely based on the last third which is why this isn't an 8/10.

I'm starting to wonder if there's an actual point to watching every Wes Anderson movie because even when the stories are different, they all feel the same except for whichever one is your favorite. It's like listening to the discography of a long-lived and consistent musician or group, where whatever album you connect to most is a personal thing that's hard to replicate, and every other album is more of the same but can never rise to the top like that one managed to do (for me it's _The Grand Budapest Hotel_).

The alien scenes gave me a great big smile. I also loved the three little girls.

7/10
