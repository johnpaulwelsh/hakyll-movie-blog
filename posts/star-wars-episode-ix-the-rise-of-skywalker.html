        <p>I think I will like this movie more when I see it a second time. With <em>The Last Jedi</em>, I needed to step away from the movie itself and view it from the mythical perspective to really decide if I liked the direction the movie was going, and I want to do the same with this one.</p>
<p>Lore whores will HATE this movie, there are so many Force powers and planets and background plotlines that don’t show up anywhere in the other movies, and I’m sure they are contradicted by the post-2012 extended universe. But I don’t care and I never have.</p>
<p>The “all of the Sith/Jedi are in me” thing is great, and I’m surprised it didn’t come up earlier.</p>
<p>I think Kylo’s character arc could have been stronger. He was easily the most interesting character in <em>TLJ</em> but I feel like the reasons he does things in this movie are either really obvious, or seem too much like the script forcing him to do it instead of it being a naturally occurring development.</p>
<p>Palpatine’s planet is the coolest thing in the whole new trilogy.</p>
<p>The up-down-up-down with Rey and Kylo in the last 20 minutes was a little overboard. You could fit like two <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em> endings in there, with how many “did they die?” moments there were.</p>
<p>Is Leia doing Jedi training a backwards fix for her crazy Force powers in <em>TLJ</em>? Maybe, but it makes sense considering that she was known to be Force-sensitive as of Episode 6, and they did the Laura Palmer flashback technique which was really cool.</p>
<p>Lots of plot threads came out of nowhere, but maybe who cares? When <em>TESB</em> came out, Palpatine was pulled out of thin air. The only difference here is that Episodes 7, 8, and 9 were intended to be a trilogy, so I guess there’s an expectation that the story will be unified and thought-out from the get-go.</p>
<p>No idea how much of Leia was CGI and how much was live action leftover footage, but the CGI was impressive enough where I could barely tell the difference obviously.</p>
