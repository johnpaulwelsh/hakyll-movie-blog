Not an all-time classic but much more watchable than I expected it to be. The Miser songs are amazing as I expected. But I was shocked at how well Blue Christmas works as a song directed to an absent Santa. Whoever had that idea better have had a bonus that year. The fact that Santa fixes the issue with Vixen immediately without telling Jingle and Jangle about it is very weird plotting, like how did they let that get in to the final script? Also I know the whole movie is Santa propaganda, and especially that song that Santa and the dad sing in the kitchen, but man I still found that song affecting and not too saccharine.

7/10
