_A Nightmare on Elm Street_ is simply a fantastic horror movie. I kind of assumed that it would be kinda trashy and gross and not scary at all, because that's how I imagine a lot of "classic" horror movies are for some reason. But actually it's really smart, exciting, and fun.

I already talked to my friend Rob about the film so I don't have a lot of concrete thoughts to put in this post. So here is a bullet list of thoughts:

* Fred Kreuger is hilarious, and his stretchy-arms in his first major scene are the funniest thing I've seen in a while.

* Tina is a bitch and has the best death scene ever.

* Nancy is one of my favorite horror protagonists ever. She's smart, funny, and adorable.

* The dream sequences in the first half are legitimately creepy at times, especially the one in school.

* The music is so 80s I can't even handle it.

* I didn't even notice which character was Johnny Depp until I looked up the cast list. I'm still in disbelief.

9/10
