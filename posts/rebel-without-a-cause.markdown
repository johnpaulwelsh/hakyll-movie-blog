This is an amazing movie. There's something about it that's really true and honest about teenagers and parents, although I can't easily articulate what the truths are. The things that stick out to me are:

Jim's dad is totally emasculated, and Jim wants a strong male figure in his life. His mom is really commanding in a nasty and selfish way. Their conversations before and after the chicken fight are outstanding, it's fascinating to see Jim wish to turn himself in and his dad hem and haw about how it's not the right thing to do. Maybe you can chalk it up to Jim being idealistic which is a common criticism of kids in his position in society, but I was 100% on his side and it was shocking to see his parents be so morally murky about the whole affair, you'd expect a youth to want to dodge responsibility and his parents to force him to face them, not the inverse which is what we see here.

Other than what I said above, I didn't feel the need to take sides between the adults and the kids, I just loved watching their conflicts. The kids were constantly exaggerating their experiences and feelings, but I never criticized them for it.

The dynamic between Jim, Judy, and Plato is really interesting, the adopted parents angle and everything.

Two gripes: Plato isn't as sympathetic as he could be, because he shot some puppies at the beginning of the movie, which seems very out of character. And the ending seems kind of weird, tonally. There doesn't seem to be enough grieving on the part of Jim and Judy, and Jim's parents have this smiling moment to themselves almost like "now he's found a nice girl, maybe he's on the right path now". It just feels weird.

9/10
