This is just a really good episode of the show. It has really funny and zany moments, but doesn't go overboard with them like some of the dream-sequence episodes did (the _Christmas Carol_ one and the dream-doctor one in particular). It also had some "just good" stuff, like the showdown at the prison and the abandoned mental asylum part, and the movie references were on point (_The Spanish Prisoner_? I've written about that one!).

The appearance of Lassiter would have been a disappointingly short one, had I not already been aware that the second _Psych_ movie was called _Lassie Come Home_ so I know I get to see him more in the next one.

8/10
