Despite the fact that I enjoyed watching this movie for the most part, there are a lot of aspects to it that didn't sit well with me. I think it's way too obvious that the film wants to dunk on disconnected rich people, and although sometimes it's done in a really funny way that shows the people on the boat are privileged and selfish, other times it's just punishing them in a not-that-funny way (the vomit, obviously, but also somewhat their experience on the desert island).

I think the most interesting part of the movie overall is the last third on the island. I was expecting the emergence of Abigail as the captain would be a subtle power-inversion, but she becomes arrogant almost immediately instead of meek or naive or nice. I guess I was expecting more of the servant from _Knives Out_ suddenly finding that only she can do simple survival things, but that's not at all what happened.

The gender/power dynamic that Carl goes through in the beginning and the end of the movie are clearly meant to be related, but surprisingly it's not that obvious what the connection is, considering that everything else in the whole movie was obvious almost to a fault.

There are a couple other details that bother me. Why does so much chaos get instigated by the drunk captain? What does that mean? Is it just comedic happenstance or is there a point about communists? And why does that one old lady seem to get the worst of the vomit and diarrhea punishment?

The part where the vomiting woman is encouraged to wash it down with champagne instead of water feels very reminiscent of _Idiocracy_:  "Its got electrolytes, it's what plants crave!"

All that being said, I think I liked it more than disliked it. And I think the ending is fabulous. I love the ambiguity of Carl running through the woods, even though (again) I think the movie is trying to make a point that it doesn't quite deliver into coherence.

6/10
