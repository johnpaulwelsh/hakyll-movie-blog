        <p>I have to admit, the twist is really well done, and makes so many things make sense in hindsight. It’s also thematically rich, not just making the events of the story make more sense but also bringing a different meaning to the whole story itself.</p>
<p>Things that make more sense after the reveal: - the mother doesn’t set out two breakfasts - sometimes Lukas just disappears for short stretches of time - Lukas is consistently suspicious of the mother - only one kid is sitting at the table with the other - the sexton only talks to one kid - it seemed a little odd that the parents would separate after a car accident where only the mother got injured, and then not really too badly</p>
<p>There was a really short time at the beginning where the thought crossed my mind, “what if the brother is made-up?” But I dismissed it because I didn’t really base the thought off of any evidence, and all the photos showing twins disproved that easily.</p>
<p>I really liked how ambiguously the movie depicted the mother character right up until the end. In my head it started out as a movie where someone was abusing them as a mother impersonator, and then it became one where the kids were being really unreasonable and the mother (whether it was an impersonator or not) was the victim of torture. But it never fully tipped towards the mother seeming to be the real one - it kept it ambiguous arguably all the way through.</p>
<p>The fact that it was such a slow build, and there was such a low simmer of tension almost the entire time, makes the violence near the end really upsetting to watch.</p>
<p>One thing I’ve never liked about certain foreign movies is that sometimes, the characters have totally blank expressions the entire time, even when a normal person would be expressing some kind of emotion. I think in general the bleak and sad atmosphere of this movie makes it make a little more sense, and it’s notoriously hard to get kid actors to emote convincingly. But the mom spends so much of the movie being restrained, and the kids spend so much time being spooky and that it’s kind of dull for the first 30 minutes or so.</p>
<p>The almost total lack of music helped make it feel kind of creepy and dreamlike.</p>
<p>7/10 (7.5)</p>
