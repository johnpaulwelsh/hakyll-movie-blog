Nice, but shallow. Usually with coming-of-age slice-of-life dramas, either the kid's progression and development is interesting, or the historical or cultural environment surrounding him is interesting. But in this movie both were just okay. And like, if you're going to tell the story of a noncombatant Protestant family in a ghetto of Catholics during The Troubles, I think the confrontation presented to the characters has to be stronger than "my crush is a Catholic" and "the looting is scary and I don't like it." The movie was begging to have a broader lesson learned about religious conflict but it didn't have one.

The "I must be brave" song during the showdown in the street is a bit on the nose.

Seeing well-meaning Protestants misunderstand Catholicism is amusing.

The music is good, but I think that's just because Van Morrison is good.

The scenes with the grandpa are the best.

7/10
