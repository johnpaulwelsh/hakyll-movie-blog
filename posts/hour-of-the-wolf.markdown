I really want to like this more than I do, but there are so many frustrating elements.

For example, if you're going to have a psychological horror set on an isolated island, at least make the instigating incident more comprehensible. It seems like he killed that boy for no reason at all, and then none of his demons (real or imagined) ever address it. It's like the movie can't decide what aspect of Johan's psyche to explore - lust over Veronica, guilt over killing the boy, frustration over failed art ventures, distance from Alma. They are all mixed in but I can't figure out which one matters the most. There even seemed to be some element of "hell is other people," especially with the dinner scene near the beginning, but that whole thing really only makes sense once you realize they are ghosts (I guess that's what they are?).

But... there are part of this I liked, a lot! The weird horny old women, the creepy puppet guy (his puppet show gave me deep Lady in the Radiator vibes), the whole sequence once Johan goes to the castle alone honestly was pretty awesome. Liv Ullman's face is so earnest and she shows emotion really well, it reminded me of Shelly Duvall in _The Shining_ and also a little bit of my own wife, for some reason. The way the sunlight gleams off of the rocks is so harsh and intriguing.

I would absolutely love to read or watch a critial assessment of this movie, not necessarily to "solve" the plot, but more to figure out what the heck Bergman might have been thinking when he wrote the screenplay. It's just so all over the place.

I think one of the issues here is the movie wants both Johan and Alma to be the protagonist. Johan is the artist and it's his diary and struggles we are experiencing, but Alma is the one we can empathize with and she's the narrator of the story.

6/10
