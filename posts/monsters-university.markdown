It's cute.

While it might not be my preference, I don't see any reason why someone couldn't watch this one first, and then _Monsters Inc._ afterwards. This movie doesn't spoil anything and it explains things relatively well, except maybe for the whole "screams are our power source" thing which is explained very well in the intro of the original movie.

7/10
