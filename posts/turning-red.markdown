Finally! A female puberty movie that's simultaneously an extended metaphor and also a positive story instead of a weird psychosexual fever dream.

The whole time I kept thinking, this is just like _Eighth Grade_, but appropriate for an audience of actual eighth graders. It even has a heart-to-heart with dad at the climax, and a weird first-crush storyline that leads to close calls with sexual exposure (practicing blowjobs in _Eighth Grade_, and "showing the panda" (clearly a metaphor for nudity) in _Turning Red_).

Pixar treads a fine line with all the sexual implications in this one, like more than I even realized while watching. Some of the euphemisms are shockingly on-point ("did the red peony bloom?" like holy crap that's almost PG-13 by itself).

The boy-band angle to the story must have been a major stroke of luck. When they greenlit this, I bet One Direction was a recent big thing so they guessed the young audience would at least kinda get what it was like to be into a boy band in the early 2000s. But I was actually there and I can tell you it's 100% accurate.

I like that the movie is all about empowering the kids to be that particularly terrible kind of young teenage girl, and it's totally fine with that. There's no underlying message of "don't worry you'll grow out of it," even though we all know that is the inevitable direction kids take. It's just really comfortable with teenagers being cringey and emotional and there's no cynical smile behind the good vibes.

The scene where 4*Town helps them sing their way to the ritual is dope, and I'm not afraid to admit it.

The narration is kinda conventional about "learn who you are" but I mostly don't mind because the message is good and necessary. I will say though, the "my panda, my choice" line is pandering and dumb and I rolled my eyes all the way back when I heard it.

9/10
