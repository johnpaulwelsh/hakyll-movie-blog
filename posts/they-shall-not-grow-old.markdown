This film is absolutely amazing. Gripping from the first frame to the last. The simplicity of the presentation (audio from veterans + contemporary video) really helps to bring the subject matter down to earth. But the crowning achievement is the colorization, restoration, and sound reenactment given to the bulk of the footage. Technology is amazing nowadays, that we can make 100-year-old film look modern.

10/10
