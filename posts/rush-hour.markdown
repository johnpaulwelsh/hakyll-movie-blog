It's cute. There are some enjoyable scenes but most of it is just passable action comedy.

Chris Tucker's character starts out annoying but gets funny before too long. Jackie Chan's character has basically no personality.

There isn't nearly enough kung-fu, if you compare this to one of Jackie's Hong Kong movies you'll be sorely disappointed.

6/10
