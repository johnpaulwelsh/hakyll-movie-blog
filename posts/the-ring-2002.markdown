Somehow, I liked this more than the original!

At first I didn't think I would because the acting was so in-your-face. The teenagers are all sneery and attitude-y, Rachel is almost comically obtuse about her own son in the after-school scene, and the contents of the videotape are kinda goofy and random, with a "what's a creepy thing we can show?" vibe.

But the main selling point of this version over the original, is that the story makes way more sense. Even though I am usually open to supernatural elements in my already-supernatural stories, the fact that the ex-husband is psychic and knows all this background information kind-of puts a big weight around the neck of the original _Ringu_. So the fact that this version reveals all the background information through Samara-induced flashbacks and, you know, actual investigative reporting and feet-on-the-ground research, is kind of admirable. In the original, almost all the good information comes from the stupid ex-husband just knowing stuff, whereas in this one Rachel is doing her damn job for a large portion of the story. I'd say that Rachel in this movie is a pretty kickass woman honestly, but that could be the fact that I have had a crush on Naomi Watts for most of my adulthood.

The same faults in the original are present here. The emotional payoff of Rachel "freeing" Samara in the well is completely undone by the final twist, and it feels just as cheap in both versions of the story. There are a few too many details in the story of the Morgan family to really hold them in your head well (horses, mom went crazy, Samara has chronic insomnia, etc., whereas in the original it was the volcano, the psychic abilities, and the secret child who had obviously evil powers before she ever got pushed down the well).

I was impressed with how much the first half of the movie is almost based on the same script as the original. Little details like Aidan and the ex-husband meeting in the rain on the sidewalk, and Katie hovering near the fridge when she first hears the TV turn on.

The little scene where Rachel is looking into all the other apartment units' windows at their TVs, I don't know why but I really like that. One part of it is clearly a reference to _Rear Window_ because there's a guy laid up in a wheelchair!

This version of the movie is definitely more "American." In the original movie, every teenager is sweet and polite, every adult is reserved and cerebral, and every kid is just a blank face. But in this one, the teenagers are snotty, the adults are impulsive and loud, and the kids are still creepy but in more of a personality way?

The visual markers are more interesting in this movie, especially the creepy red tree and the lighthouse. I did also like that every element of the tape in this version has a direct visual callback later, especially the ladder.

It's hilarious to me that in 2002 we still had VHS but we also had enough internet where that is an equally important research tool to good old-fashioned books, when Rachel is looking into Anna Morgan.

It was nice to see that the ex-husband character is an A/V nerd, and that's how they research the details of the tape. As opposed to the characters noticing things and being knowledgable for no apparent reason.

8/10
