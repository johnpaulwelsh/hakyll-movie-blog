Imperfect, but most of the time it's pretty great. The intimate and amateurish way it's shot really brings you close to Mikey and Nicky's states of mind and makes the tension even higher. Watching Mikey after you know that he's involved in the hit is so amazing, you can see how stressed out he is every time Nicky distracts from the plan. Early on it reminded me of dealing with my toddler daughter, trying to change her train of thought to get her to do something, or making her eat something she doesn't want to eat. It's interesting that the movie slowly reveals Nicky as being kind of a piece of crap: womanizer, racist, and selfish. But Mikey doesn't really get worse in our eyes as the movie goes on, he just stays the same, a traitor who seems really emotionally confused about whether he wants to go through with it or not. The women in this movie are so pathetic and weird. There are more continuity errors between shots in this movie than in any other I've ever seen, like whether somebody is holding a cigarette or not, or the positions of their hands. I kind of liked it though, it made the movie feel more stream-of-conciousness.

8/10
