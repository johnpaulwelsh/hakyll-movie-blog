Jumps around set pieces and ideas and songs with the hyperactive lack of focus that _Meet the Robinsons_ does, but it's much more enjoyable than that movie because the setting and characters are less annoying. When the movie decides to slow down and rest in its own world (especially the bull fight at the end), that's when it's at its best. Otherwise it's a serviceable kids movie that is really so similar to _Coco_ that I'm surprised whoever made their movie second didn't cancel the project after the earlier one came out.

Making pop and rock songs into mariachi songs is a good idea, more people should do that.

6/10
