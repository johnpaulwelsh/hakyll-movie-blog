Entertaining, but also clearly a wasted opportunity. The book is a masterpiece of fascinating storytelling, because Tommy Wiseau, the rest of the real people behind the making of _The Room_, and the final product itself, seem totally divorced from each others' universes, and yet it happened. This movie seems to be trying to make it more of a "zero-to-hero" story but starring the most oblivious and self-centered guy ever, but without making it into a tragedy (since the movie did end up getting made, of course). It makes a lot of parts seem totally phony, like the cast members laughing at Tommy over lunch, or the convenient timing of the fight and break-up between Tommy and Greg. And some absurd details aren't lingered on long enough, like the fact that Tommy chose to shoot the entire movie on purchased (not rented) equipment, and in digital and on film at the same time!

It makes a lot of sense for them to turn Sandy the script supervisor into the audience surrogate, making snarky comments on the side about the absurdity of the story and the acting. Most folks who aren't die-hard _The Room_ fans aren't going to know the common reference points, and some might not believe those things happened that way in the actual movie, so somebody has to comment on it. But it's probably the single element that makes the movie feel like just a mid R-rated comedy, or worse, a Rifftrax recording.

But overall I can't help but enjoy watching it. Seeing the recreations of the scenes, the actor lookalikes, the sets, everything about the actual behind-the-scenes is fascinating and done with a commendable sense of realism and accuracy. I actually thought Nathan Fielder was the real guy who played Peter before I realized I knew who he was as an actor from other things.

The Tommy/"Tommy" cameo after the credits isn't actually the greatest.

Re-watched on my 6th wedding anniversary, lol.

6/10
