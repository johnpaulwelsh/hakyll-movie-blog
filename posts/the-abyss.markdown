That was an unbelievably great experience. It was such a big screen and the sound was so big and loud but still like really well balanced and the chairs shook like I don't know if XD counts as 4D cinema but wow what a great
theater to see that in. I can totally understand why like some theaters closer to me just weren't equipped to show something like that. It was unbelievable.
So it's really long obviously and I can't like it's unfair to the movie to judge it on its parts. Like I can totally see some reviewer from 1988 being like yeah it's hooky and there's parts that are unrealistic
and the ending is sentimental as shit but like no that undercuts the fact that it is gripping the entire way for it.
Now I will say it is a slow, slow progression. Like at an hour and a half in my estimate by looking at my clock my watch. At an hour and a half in I was like I could really feel time taking a long time.
Like it wasn't as long as it was with the flower moon but it was the same thing there. I felt like I was sitting there for 3 and a half hours. It wasn't like accidentally a blink of an eye. Lord of the Rings kind of things where you don't realize how long it's going because it's just so compelling.
But this movie is just amazing. Like everyone likes to crap on Avatar but the guy who made Avatar made this first and obviously I mean I need to go and figure out what he had made before this.
I think it was just Terminator and like something else that I'm forgetting. It's just impossible for me to believe that on the goodwill of Terminator 1 James Cameron was given the money and freedom to make that.
It's just so detailed and it's so realistic. So it's like mostly I had thought that it was going to shift into heavy sci-fi here and then never let up.
But there's like little hints and appearances of the aliens but then it cuts right back to life and death, scientific survival and action. It's a proper movie and not just a back door into a sci-fi.
Right? And it's just I am really glad that I read Shadow Diaper for watching this because I knew about the oxygen liquid, I knew about the symptoms of poison, of the death poison that they get.
I knew about how when you come back up, you need to slowly reactivate to the pressure changes. And I don't know man, it's just amazing. It's an amazing movie. It's amazing to me that they made that in 1988.
And okay, so I don't know what a bad digital noise reduction restoration job looks like. But if I go home and this thing comes out on 4K Blu-ray and I see reviews of people saying that it's been DNR to hell, I'm going to just fess up and say I don't know what they're talking about.
Because when I just saw on that theater, I can see some film grain, I can see detail, everyone looked like a person, everything looked right. And it was perfect. It was better than anyone has ever seen it. Not even 1988 could movie theaters have shown something that good.
I had a funny thought that the aliens are the first doom strollers because of all the war footage and news coverage. They seem to be ingesting that kind of camey laugh.
Also, you know, someone else can also dismiss it as, oh, it's 2001 a space Odyssey but under water or oh, it's contact but under water.
And yes, those might be accurate comparisons, but that doesn't make anybody enjoy either thing being compared better.
It's just like the fact that stories may be similar just means that the thing that they're getting at is important to human beings.
So if someone goes their whole life having only seen the abyss and not contact, I'm not going to be too upset because I think that they can get the same value out of this as I got out of contact.
I really like that it wasn't like I don't know any of those actors. I've heard the name of Harris, but like it wasn't starring Tom Hanks or starring, you know, Robert De Niro.
And it's just like a really aggressively real time submarine disaster movie with like an ET plot shoved on top.
So like it clearly has, I don't know if you can call it subtext, but it clearly has well thought out developments, right?
So it's a man and a wife who are on the rocks in their marriage because they're too headstrong and they met on some kind of work detail where they were stuck on a boat together and that brought them together and then they get married as a joke argument.
They got married so that they would have nicer logic on the next boat. So like, of course it would be so appropriate that their relationship would meant by being stuck on another vessel.
And I love that I don't care how realistic it is. I love that his wedding band saved his life where that door was closing on it. It's convenient and it's kind of like, I see what you did there.
Your marriage is still strong, if you think of it, but I don't care. I am very anti-any position of, this is too hokey or too sentimental or too, to American movie-ish.
Also, it was made while the Russians were still the bad guys, like this so feels like the kind of thing that would be made in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union and not mere to the end of the fall of the Soviet Union, but it still hasn't happened yet.
I don't know, I'm impressed by this the same way that I'm impressed that Casablanca was made during World War II when people weren't really trying to be Casablanca to get out of Europe.

It is an insult to this movie, to watch it on AMC TV station, with commercials and editing
and cut for time and content.
It's just an offense because it is so insistent that every minute counts that it's I'm just
so glad that I was able to see it in the way that I was.

9/10
