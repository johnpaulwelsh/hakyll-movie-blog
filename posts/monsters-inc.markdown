This viewing convinced me of its brilliance in a way that other viewings didn't (I mean, 9 to 10 isn't a big jump but still). It's not as much of an adventure as my Pixar stereotype template led me to remember: Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Inside Out are probably the most obvious "awkward pairing set out on an adventure they didn't plan on having" examples, and I assumed that this movie was the same but you actually get to see a lot more of how their society works before they start hopping through doors. Also the scream extractor is pretty scary.

The most important part of this viewing for me was watching it with my two daughters. The 20-month-old was laughing and pointing at the screen and generally having a great time. Meanwhile my 3.75-year-old one was scared and cuddling against me the entire time, especially after the CDA agents show up.

Boo is very cute but of indeterminate age. She can sing and use the potty, but she also looks and dresses and speaks like she's maybe 22 months old.

Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfect casting decisions for these roles, like maybe the most perfect Pixar casting other than Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear.

The restaurant is called Harryhausen's, that's funny!

10/10
