        <p>A beautiful and sad tale about the highs and lows of immature romanticism. My grumpy old conservative tendencies really came through while watching this. I see it as an excellent cautionary tale, and it works even better as one due to the early part of the film being so effective at depicting lighthearted escapism.</p>
<p>Nudity! That was unexpected.</p>
<p>I love the shots where Monika and Harry look into the distance and the background gets dark. When Monika does it, she’s hanging out with some other guy but we don’t see what she’s thinking about, so we don’t know if it’s regret or satisfaction in her eyes. When Harry does it, he’s remembering the good times with Monika, while he’s holding his little baby and taking steps into maturity alone in the world. I was touched by that, especially as a new parent to a girl with a similar name to June. I wonder if Monika wants the name because she has self-resentment, while Harry wants Monika because he is still devoted to her.</p>
