What an outstanding film.

The editing is some of the best I've seen. It really felt like I was in the room with him the entire time, it was all so natural. Somehow 90+ minutes of mostly-still shots of a man on the phone never got boring and I never became too aware of the editing itself. It seamlessly blended together the entire time and that's quite an achievement.

I really don't have much else to say. The story was perfect, the acting was perfect, and the craft was perfect.

10/10
