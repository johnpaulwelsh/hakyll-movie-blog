It's a nice movie.

I absolutely fit this movie into the category of "kids story where awkward kid is exposed to something quirky and challenging, to make him appreciate life better." It's a pretty good example of it too, but there are some aspects to it that really only make sense within a kids movie. Also I think it doesn't quite lean far enough into the _Big Fish_ themes of stories being more important than their truth, or maybe I'm just projecting that onto this movie because I like _Big Fish_ so much.

Michael Caine does a great job of playing a southern American.

There are a lot of slice-of-life scenes that are really adorable, like the gardening scenes.

Haley Joel Osment is good in some scenes and kinda bad in others, it's like as he got older he became more of a typical kid actor instead of the amazing kind of kid actor that he was in _The Sixth Sense_ and _AI: Artificial Intelligence_.

The stuff with the mom and Walter are pretty implausible, I feel like he didn't really do anything to become the kind of kid who could convince his mom to let him loose to live with his sketchy uncles.

7/10
