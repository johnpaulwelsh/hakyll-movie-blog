Before the movie: most relaxing menu music on a DVD ever.

After finishing the movie: oh no, actually the saddest menu music ever!

I love this film. How do I count the ways?

The beginning is so compact at telling you what's going on and who the characters are. It's very nearly hard to follow, but just clear enough. Great editing.

It's so effective at making me feel the way the protagonist feels. The first half I'm becoming smitten with the woman, with a lingering suspicion that she's not telling the truth, then at the midpoint turn I feel betrayed, then when she shows up again I slowly realize that she's pursuing him like a lovesick puppy. It feels futile to even outline it like that though. This movie is just really good at telling a story with complicated emotions.

I really like how this movie shows us what's happening on phones. It doesn't feel too hokey. I'm just glad to see a detective story set in modern times so that they can't make it easy for themselves by having no digital devices around.

10/10
