        <p>aka Sisterly Love and Emotional Struggle, The Movie.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how the story manages to suck you in and endear you to every character so quickly, when it doesn’t appear to be centered around any one conflict. Every character is so bold and has so much heart.</p>
<p>Saiorse Ronan looks so much like she could be Laura Dern’s real daughter, it’s scary.</p>
<p>There are two or three spots where one of the sisters makes some speech about how hard it is to make money as a woman in this world, and while it’s not inaccurate, it really feels shoehorned in to be as obvious and TV-commercial-worthy as possible. I wish the movie would just let me as the audience observe the struggle between pressures towards wifehood and the will to carve your own path in life, instead of having someone beat me over the head with it. They did it really well with the class issues, why not the gender issues too?</p>
