This was a pretty uneven movie.

The framing device of the whole story being a flashback was unexpected, and for most of the movie I didn't understand why it was there at all. Once it cut back to current-time I felt a lot different about the character Sally, so that made me think the framing device succeeded at its job. But once the movie was finishing up and the current-time story resolved itself, I didn't think it made much sense story-wise. I got the feeling that Sally was going to say she's going blind, just like Alexander did. But her hangups never seem to get explained, and she just resigns herself to go with Johannes.

I guess overall I am confused by the characterization of Sally, she's the only one who I never really understood her motivations or feelings, because they often seemed to contradictory.

On the other hand, there were a lot of moments that had a good amount of power and artistic flair to them, especially the attempted-murder scene and Alexander sitting in his room afterwards. The music was also pretty good, whenever it did show up. And all the other main characters had compelling personalities and I enjoyed watching them. Similar to _Crisis_, this movie somehow convinced me to care about these characters who have a small story to tell, nothing grand or deep or important.

5/10
