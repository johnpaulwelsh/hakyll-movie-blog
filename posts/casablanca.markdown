That's number 900!

I'm surprised to learn that almost all the lines I know from this movie are in the last 10 minutes ("maybe not today," "hill of beans," "usual suspects," "beautiful friendship"). It's very likely I know them from parodies on Nickelodeon and from the Angry Alien 30 Second Bunny Videos as much as I do from just general cultural knowledge. Not sure if that says something about me, but I'll take it.

The movie is extraordinarily well-written. The pacing right from the beginning is brisk, exciting, and purposeful. Everybody talks fast but in a way that feels effortless instead of flashy. I was actually worried the romance angle would override the broader morality concerns, and by the final act I was seriously unsure what kind of man Rick is. So the ending was just that more moving for me, because I was essentially watching it for the first time (even though I had internalized so many details from the aforementioned cultural reference points).

The acting is great - every character is precise and memorable, even little Peter Lorre scampering around like a mouse. I'm not sure offhand if I've seen Ingrid Bergman in a film before but she's absolutely enchanting in _Casablanca_. Maybe she's beautiful in everything she stars in, but I doubt she could surpass this role.

The music is first-rate as well. I never thought a score could incorporate a single melody into so many different situations and make them all work without getting stale, but I guess that means "As Time Goes By" is some kind of magical juju song that works in all keys, tempos, and modes.

It's not the best movie ever, but I think it's a very well executed one and I wouldn't be surprised if I came to like it even more on rewatches.

9/10
