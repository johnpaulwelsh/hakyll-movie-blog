This feels a lot like a Shakespeare comedy, and I kind of loved it. Some of the characterizations were inscrutable and almost contradictory, but it goes down easier if you think of them all as exaggerated characters in a story. For example if you think of the son as an embodiment of pent-up sexual frustration, it makes a lot more sense than trying to fit his behavior into a more nuanced framework as if he were really his own character. It also makes the endless philosophical musings about men, women, love, and age feel less cringey and more self-knowingly theatrical, sort of like the scene in the beginning where the countess in the play is spouting idioms and adages all over the place.

This movie has a great wit, wonderful acting, and somehow it's an example of "casual adultery played for laughs" that didn't totally rub me the wrong way (see all of Charlie Kaufman's films and _The Crying of Lot 49_).

The film is so chock-full of themes that I think I'll take something else away from each successive viewing as I go through life. Right now I latched on the most to the idea of maturing into a relationship and how seemingly everyone in the movie has a really hard time with it.

I don't even need to see the remaining 38 Bergman movies in the Criterion set to know that this is a really great start to the "film festival" sequence.

Also this movie is way sexier than I would have expected from something from 1955. I guess I need to start watching more movies from the 50s that weren't stifled by the Hayes code.

9/10
