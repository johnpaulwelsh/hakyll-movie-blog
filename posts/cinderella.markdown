There are parts I like. The songs are good, the human animation is impressive, the Duke and his aide are funny. But man I just don't care about the rest. There are so many cat and mouse chase sequences that even my toddler daughter got bored with them. I guess people in the 1950s had much lower standards for their animated features.

5/10
