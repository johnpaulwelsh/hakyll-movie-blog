        <p>I watched this film relatively late at night on a weekend in its original Cantonese with subtitles, and it felt like the perfect movie to watch at that time of night when you feel pretty tired but want to stay up and see what happens.</p>
<p>It took a little while to get used to the silly sound effects, but it was fine after the first couple fights.</p>
<p>The story was more involved than I expected it to be. It was interesting to have the Venoms collaborating with each other, and especially how the Snake was wielding the local police power to his advantage using ultra-obvious corruption. Especially the fact that the identity of each Venom is doled out so evenly across the runtime of the movie. It might have been obvious off the bat which characters were Venoms, but I liked how it took its time revealing each particular Venom. And saving one as a surprise for the end was a great idea.</p>
<p>I’m surprised I didn’t have that much trouble following the plot after a while. There were some spots in the middle third of the movie that got a bit hairy, like who the two guys were in the restaurant that told the Gecko what happened while he was gone, and how they came to find out how The Toad, Mufta, and Lin had died.</p>
<p>The final fight is really stellar, and worth the wait.</p>
<p>The music was really good, it used single instruments in interesting ways.</p>
<p>I liked how it always did a close-up of someone’s face to confirm they had died.</p>
<p>The blood was the least convincing blood I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>I liked how the plot basically just wrapped itself up in a couple of lines of dialogue, after the fight finished.</p>
<p>The special effects of the Gecko and last student standing on the walls was awesome.</p>
<p>I LOVED the way the camera moved, it really lived up to the cheesy kung-fu camera style I had come to expect from watching Tarantino.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
