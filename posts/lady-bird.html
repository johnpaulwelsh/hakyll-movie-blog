        <p>For the first half of the movie, it felt like a fast-forward of <em>Eighth Grade</em>, in a good way. It has all the nostalgic hits for my own lived experience, but with small changes depending on the timeframe and location. I especially loved the way the Catholic high school and stage musical settings were used, it felt very true to my own experience.</p>
<p>Then things start getting emotionally complicated, and Lady Bird starts doing and experiencing all the things that make me anxious during high school movies. Drugs, hanging out with shallow assholes, ditching her old nice friend, premarital sex. But also, the money issues that plague the family, the anxiety about class optics, the dad losing his job, the passive-aggressive behavior of the mom, and Lady Bird’s short fuse in return.</p>
<p>In the end though, I think the movie picks itself out of the hole and correctly resolves all of those loose threads in a way that resonated with me.</p>
<p>I think the centerpiece/pivot moments are the most effective, and rubbed me the right way more than some of the intermediate scenes. The <em>Crash into Me</em> bonding session (and the callback later when she visits Jules), and maybe most importantly, Lady Bird visiting a church in NYC to sort of wake herself up and kick her into making a positive change.</p>
<p>Movies are subjective so I’m just gonna say, this family needs more Jesus. I choose to find a dramatic irony in the fact that (almost) all the positive things in her life are centered in a Catholic school setting, and (almost) all the negative ones take her away from that influence. I think her affection for Sacramento gets wrapped into that as well. So I would honestly have been pissed, not just because of my own religious inclinations, but also because it would not have correctly paid off all the establishing elements centered around her school.</p>
<p>Ultimately I liked Lady Bird as a character, but there were times where I was like shaking my fist at the screen because of the boneheaded stuff she was getting into. There were also times where I sympathized with the mom, but honestly she was out of line more than 75% of the time. I guess those mixed feelings are all elements of an excellent drama film, but it’s not striking me as a top-notch film or all-time favorite.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective it’s perfectly fine, nothing really stunned me or disappointed me.</p>
