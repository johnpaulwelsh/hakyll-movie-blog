This is a cool movie. The music is great, very tough but also jazzy sometimes. Seeing everybody be total scuz-bags is pretty satisfying because you know early on that there is no nuance, it's just about a bunch of bad guys who get outsmarted by a slightly less bad guy. I think Sanjuro is more honorable than the equivalent character in _A Fistful of Dollars_, but I would need to rewatch that one to make sure.

As is typical of Japanese movies, I forgot who certain characters were because they all look similar.

It's pretty amazing how convincing Sanjuro is as a master swordsman who you don't want to mess with, given how little sword play actually happens involving him. He just explodes with action for a few seconds and everyone dies.

It was fun to see how he survived the showdown against the gun, because I thought the bullet would hit his spade like what happens in _AFOD_, but instead he flings it like an arrow which is was practicing in the shrine. Pretty slick.

8/10
