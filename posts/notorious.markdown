Pretty much perfect. The drama, thrills, romance, and especially the performances are magnificent. The key and teacup are both instantly memorable objects, I can totally understand why they chose those scenes as a model for the DVD and Blu-Ray cases. I much prefer this kind of Hitchcock (along with _Rebecca_ and _Strangers on a Train_) compared to something like _Psycho_.

10/10
