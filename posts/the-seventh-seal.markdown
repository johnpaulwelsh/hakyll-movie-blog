I can't tell you that I understand this movie. But I can say that I like it, and that I think there's something special about it.

It started off really shaky. Silent credits, then a blaring "Dies Irae" chorus, then the most obviously fake hawk in the sky that I've ever seen, followed by some really tight and claustrophobic reverse-shot between Antonious and Death as they begin talking. I was afraid the movie was going to feel like an amateur play, and not like a Film.

But somewhere around the play being staged for the villagers, I started to come around to what the movie was doing. I found the impassioned monologue about "you're all going to die" to be pretty enthralling, almost despite myself. And then once the band of travelers all get together and things get bawdy and sarcastic for a while, I really began to enjoy myself. In the second half I distinctly got the feeling that something great was happening in front of me. I get the same feeling when I watch a Spielberg movie or something else suitably mythic in its granteur. I especially was caught up in the scene where they burn the witch, and when the party arrives at the castle at the end.

I don't know where I got the prior idea that the characters in this movie would be archetypical rather than personalized, maybe just because I knew it was set during the Middle Ages where that kind of thing is common in contemporary literature. But I do like thinking about the characters as simplified forms of the human condition. Antonious is pious but feels doubt. Jors is cynical and sure of himself. Jof is goofy and Mia is light-hearted, but they're both in love and express some kind of hope, if not for the future than just for today and tomorrow. I don't think it's a coincidence that they have a baby. I'm starting to notice that any time a couple in an Ingmar Bergman story has a baby, it really sets them apart from the other couples who don't have one. Then the smith and Lisa are kind of typical dumbo and slutty wife characters. The mute housekeeper always felt kind of interesting, but she really stands out once the camera decides to dwell on her face as much as it does, near the end. I feel like there's a whole movie just in that one scene where she's looking back at the witch as she begins to burn. And of course once.

It's interesting that this film personifies Death as having a one-on-one relationship with people, while the Black Death is happening all around as this big scary thing that affects people en masse.

One of the things the movie really gets across well, is all the different ways that a person could feel like something big and important is going on. It really emphasizes the point any time a villager tells about the stories they're hearing, where a woman gives birth to a calf head or horses eat each other or something else horrifying like that. It's very Biblical, which of courses ties right in to the part of Revelation that's the source of the movie's title.

The thoughts above feel pretty basic in hindsight, and really that's all I have the mental capacity for right now. All I know is, I started out not liking the movie but I was won over by the end. And I am very very interested to read and watch some analyses and bonus features related to this movie.

I've been starting to think after watching serious movies, what can I take away from this if God is real, or if God is not real? I got a lot of that train of thought while watching _Day of Wrath_, but for this movie (even though the question seems more top of mind here) I don't really know how to approach it. If God is real, then what is Death? How does he relate to judgment? Why do everybody in the castle die instead of just Antonious and his squire? And if God is not real, then is Death all there is? And if so, what does it mean that Jof can see spiritual beings, including the Virgin and the Child at the beginning?

I am _very_ interested to know what Crouse and Rob think of this movie.

8/10
