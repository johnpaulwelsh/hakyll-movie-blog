A really great movie, just as good as I remember it from 2017. My wife and I both cried at the end back when we first saw it, and this time we both cried a the same spot, but _also_ at the flashback when Hector is singing "Remember Me" to Coco as a kid. This is the fault of our becoming parents in the interim, obviously.

I see this as a companion piece to _Soul_ in a way.

10/10
