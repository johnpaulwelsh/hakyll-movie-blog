        <p>Pretty hilarious. Obviously the filmmakers had a vision for how wacky and off-the-wall they wanted the movie to be, and I don’t think the low budget got in the way of that. The graphics are really rough, but everything else is quite good.</p>
<p>The twist isn’t much of a twist, it’s pretty well telegraphed by a couple scenes.</p>
<p>The goat song is clearly the best part of the whole movie.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
