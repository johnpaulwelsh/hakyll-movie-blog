A good old fashioned good movie. The jokey idiot nature of all those cops is one of my favorite parts. Sidney Poitier has such grace and screen presence, but he also smiles and laughs sometimes. You can totally read every thought passing through Gillespie's head, his actor does a great job. The ending feels a little rushed plot-wise. I still don't quite get how Tibbs figured out the connection with the pregnant girl, and the showdown at the end is confusing. There are some camera shots which I found pretty impressive but only because I was trying to imagine how they did them in 1967 (tracking Gillespie's car on the bridge, and the train at the end into a helicopter shot).

8/10
