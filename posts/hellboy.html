        <p>Pretty average. I see a lot of Marvel tropes in this one, like the corny one-liners, quirky side characters, over-the-top villains whose backstory is a little too complex for its own good, generally unimpressive action scenes.</p>
<p>Overall itâ€™s a fun watch though. I like that they use practical effects for at least some of the fight scenes with the egg-laying demon. If it were all CGI it would feel really lame.</p>
<p>I also like that Ron Perlman plays the character as a perfectly normal tough guy, who just happens to be a demon. Gotta wonder what kind of upbringing Hellboy had, to end up being such a typical dude.</p>
