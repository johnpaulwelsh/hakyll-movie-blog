Frankly an insane movie with no chill at all. It follows child logic, not adult logic. So much chaos, so many random moments which are funny but also devoid of substance. So many plot holes it's hardly worth listing them. And even the core emotional element of the story is undone by rushing through it and not taking the time to make me, the audience, actually care. Probably could benefit from either 20 more minutes of runtime, or half the plot to cover in the runtime that it has.

I enjoyed watching it, in a way, but I was also exhausted by the end. I told my wife when it ended, "That was interesting, but it was also bad."

4/10
