A wonderful example of those excessive, gross, kinda insane action movies that they seemed to make a lot of in the early 90s.

The only thing I knew going in is that one of the bad guys gets his face exploded by the vacuum of space, and the three-boob woman. Neither of them disappointed when I finally got to see them happen, luckily. This is a really great one to go into totally blind.

Arnold S. (as Francis York Morgan from _Deadly Premonition_ would call him) gives a perfectly "him" performance, playing both an everyday man and a military-trained action hero at the same time. His one-liners were delightful.

I didn't expect the movie to have such a twisty turny plot, and in the hands of someone else like Christopher Nolan it would probably become way too aggressive with the pulling-the-rug-out-from-under-you stuff. I just liked that there were a few spots where I was legit rethinking what I had seen before, especially in the middle right after Quaid arrives on Mars.

Naturally there are some parts of the plot that don't make any sense at all. I'll list a few of them, not as a knock against the movie, but more as an admiration of its ballsiness and willingness to cut corners to tell a good story.

- Why would the aliens build the atmosphere machine only to never turn it on?
- Why did the bad guy think it would melt down the whole planet?
- How can a planet's entire atmosphere settle into a stable "ray of sunshine" state in a mere three minutes?

The pacing of this film also is really excellent. I don't know if Paul Verhoeven's direction is actually the element that I'm perceiving here, but let's just go with that for now. Pretty much everything moves at the right speed, whether it's dialogue, action, or scenery.

The score is pretty bangin' too.

8/10
