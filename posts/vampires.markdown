Below average in every way. Gore was whatever, plot and lore were just barely interesting, and the sense of "look how cool we are" was painfully cliche.

The beginning of the movie, before the priests show up, is pretty much just boring. The music when the team is suiting up and walking to the house was hilariously repetitive. And my god, I've never seen a bigger waste of bullets in any movie.

The dialogue was the corniest shit I've heard in a long time. The "rules" were by far the worst, as if people actually talk like that. It was almost made worse by the couple times that James Woods says something honestly hilarious, like basically any time he's talking to the new priest.

There are some charms to how brainless and typical the movie is, but they could never bring it up to "so bad it's good" territory. Honestly I think my favorite part was seeing Sheryl Lee play yet another used and abused woman with crazy eyes.

4/10
