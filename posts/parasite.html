        <p>A movie about class that isn’t preachy or obvious, but still makes you think. I knew once the sister got a job that something suspicious would happen once the whole family was working for the rich folks, but what ended up happening was a total surprise. I’m glad they let the story unfold as naturally as possible once that turn occurs.</p>
<p>But who’s side does the film want me to take? The rich family is kind of annoying and flaunts their privilege often, but it’s not like they don’t deserve their wealth. The father works in a legitimately high-paying position, and the mother makes do as a housewife even though she doesn’t have any homemaking talent herself.</p>
<p>The poor family feels some resentment toward how fluffy the rich family’s life is, but at least they have ambition and don’t want to exist merely as parasites. The son especially, by the end, concludes that making money and buying the mansion is his primary goal, which is certainly a healthy conclusion to draw. Whether he actually succeeds in this is left ambiguous, which I like. The family never seems to resent wealth on its own, because they fantasize about having that much money themselves.</p>
<p>Also one of the prettiest movies I’ve seen in a while. All the actors were gorgeous, and the color and cinematography were excellent.</p>
