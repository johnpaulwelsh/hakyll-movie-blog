        <p>It’s a nice movie.</p>
<p>I absolutely fit this movie into the category of “kids stories where awkward kid is exposed to something quirky and challenging, to make him appreciate life better.” It’s a pretty good example of it too, but there are some aspects to it that really only make sense as a kids movie. Also I think it doesn’t quite lean far enough into the <em>Big Fish</em> themes of stories being more important than their truth, or maybe I’m just projecting that onto this movie because I like <em>Big Fish</em> so much.</p>
<p>Michael Caine does a great job of playing a southern American.</p>
<p>There are a lot of slice-of-life scenes that are really adorable, like the gardening scenes.</p>
<p>Haley Joel Osment is good in some scenes and kinda bad in others, it’s like as he got older he became more of a typical kid actor instead of the amazing kind of kid actor that he was in <em>The Sixth Sense</em> and <em>AI: Artificial Intelligence</em>.</p>
<p>The stuff with the mom and Walter were pretty implausible, I feel like he didn’t really do anything to become the kind of kid who could convince his mom to let him loose to live with his sketchy uncles.</p>
