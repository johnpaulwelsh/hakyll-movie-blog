This was actually pretty annoying and not that good. Usually I can forgive an older movie for having speedy marriages and talk of love that doesn't feel authentic, but it's particularly egregious in this movie. I didn't really like or sympathize with Letty at all, she simultaneously seems innocent and helpless, and also conivving and distant. I don't blame Lige for wanting to dump her on their wedding night.

The effects of the wind are pretty good, they really went all-in with the wind being scary strong all the time. But it does raise a logistical question - how can horses and cattle survive in these conditions? It's almost like a joke version of the old West.

The ending is especially bad, it almost feels tacked-on or an alternate ending. You're telling me that she kills Wirt, buries him, gets scared because she thinks he's back from the dead, sees it's Lige instead, and decides that she can stay and that she's not afraid of the wind anymore? It really felt like there should be two more scenes where she goes nuts in the house, kills Lige by accident, and then sits there going nuts all alone as the film fades out. That would have been corny, but it would have at least felt earned and connected to the other parts of the film.

Lillian Gish gives off major Sheryl Lee vibes, they give a similar facial performance if you compare this and _Twin Peaks_.

3/10
