I can't help but admit that this is a classic. It's so early-90s though, with the corny PG-13-level romantic scenes at the beginning and the old computers and the synthesizers in the score. But at the end I can't help but think that, even though it's corny and sappy, wouldn't somebody else react the same way to _E.T._ which is obviously an amazing movie?

Whoopi Goldberg once again proves that she can carry a movie on her shoulders by herself. She's so funny.

Patrick Swayze does not have a good acting face. When he finds out he's dead it's almost like a parody, he's so bad at emoting about it.

Demi Moore is really alluring, but my brain keeps switching into "she's a boy" and I have to take myself back out of it to remind myself she's a woman.

The Subway Ghost is memorable for a reason, his scenes are great and his performance is perfect.

The famous pottery scene is not that sexy, but maybe that's because I was watching it with someone who definitely did not find it sexy. I also made up a memory that the pottery scene happened once Sam becomes a ghost.

8/10
