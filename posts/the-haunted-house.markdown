Very solid. The glue joke goes on a bit too long. The ghosts and ghouls are so obviously fake it's hilarious. The stairwell is actually never not funny, and the last gag (heaven and hell) is great.

I love the way Buster holds guns, he's so sloppy and always fires by accident and looks at the barrel right before he does it.

7/10
