Beautiful and unusual. I kept thinking to myself, how would I react to this if I didn't know it had such a great reputation? Would the dialogue and scenery and music win me over if I thought some random dram made it? Or if it were a TV movie? I guess that's an issue with anything really, you can never be fully divorced from the meta elements of a movie. Even going into something blind has a built-in influence on how much you will like it.

I mean of course I found the scenes in Houston to be unbelievably great. The long long shots while you're in that phone booth are so excellent. But I didn't want to give this a 9 or a 10 because it feels too much like two movies, and the second one is better than the first even though it lasts much less time. I see the whole movie as basically Travis trying to determine, "who needs whom the most?" Does he need his kid, or his wife? Does his kid needs him, or his mom? Does she need her husband, or her kid? The answer ends up being yes for the last of those six questions. But it still feels out of place that the movie begins with him walking around in the desert in a fugue state, and the whole thing with the brother and his wife. It feels like the beginning of the movie is very allegorical, and then it gets realy concrete when you hear the whole story that Travis tells to Jane.

But this is just a way to say that it's very good, but I didn't fall head over heels in love with it. Obviously it's more important to focus on what's good here, and basically it's all of it. The kid's acting is phenomenal. The music is really haunting and evocative. The colors! Red is obviously the main thing here, but then the blues and greens seem really important too. The kid's bright red shirt when they are on the road is so crazy bright that I'm surprised they could make it look like that without blowing out all the other colors.

8/10
