        <p><strong>1) <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> (07.24.20)</strong></p>
<p>There are so many instant-classic scenes that it’s impossible to see them in their original context. The plot kinda moves along according to an unspoken logic, probably because a lot of the linkage conversations are muffled and quick. But like, you eventually figure out why Miriam is there, even if you miss the parts about her dad.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
<p><strong>2) <em>Temple of Doom</em> (07.25.20)</strong></p>
<p>This movie is so bonkers. I feel like Lucas and Spielberg were like “hey remember how all those old adventure serials were super racist and drawn out with the action scenes? Let’s make an homage to them by outdoing them on every front!”</p>
<p>I don’t actually think this movie is racist, at least not in the obvious ways. The death cult is clearly not representative of any mainstream Indian religious practices, and the poor villager at the beginning don’t come across as requiring white saviors so much as requiring anybody brave enough to venture into the unknown.</p>
<p>Short Round is a gift from God, man he is so funny and cute in this movie.</p>
<p>Willy is not nearly as annoying as I think she gets remembered as. I actually think the back and forth between her and Indiana about sexual attraction was one of the funniest parts.</p>
<p>In the end, you gotta admire this one for being super gross, and super scary, and super exciting all at once with almost no breaks in between. Even if by the end you feel exhausted.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
<p><strong>3) <em>The Last Crusade</em> (07.26.20)</strong></p>
<p>Sean Connery steals the show so hard.</p>
<p>I like the relatively smooth and slow pace of this movie, it feels very cozy.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
<p><strong>4) <em>The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</em> (07.27.20)</strong></p>
<p>If <em>Temple of Doom</em> was bonkers, this one was utterly ridiculous.</p>
<p>The character-based interactions are probably the strongest part of this movie. Indy and Mud are hilarious together, and Miriam showing back up is a delight. Also John Hurt acting like a crazy old man is always good in my book.</p>
<p>It’s pretty safe to say that every Indiana Jones installment needs some kind of creepy crawly gross-out scene, and some horrible mutilation death. But the killer ants were easily the most disturbing out of all of them (compared to them, snakes are no problem). It reminded me of the swamp of bugs in the 2005 version of <em>King Kong</em>.</p>
<p>There are weaknesses in this one to be sure, mostly having to do with plausibility and the look of the special effects. But the adventure and character stuff overrides it a bit.</p>
<p>I wonder how they’ll be able to make a fifth installment, given that we already covered almost all of the holy grails of mysterious adventure and conspiracy secrets. Maybe Atlantis is populated by yetis?</p>
<p>8/10</p>
