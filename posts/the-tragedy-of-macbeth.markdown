Really visually striking. I liked how so many of the sets seem intentionally phony, like the film is partway between an old silent film and an amateur stage-play. Also I might be misremembering the general tone of the play, but Frances MacDormand seems to give a more sympathetic portrayal of Lady Macbeth than is typical.

On the negative side, lots of scenes feel like the camera is just frozen in closeup on the face of whoever is talking, which makes some of the movie feel stagnant. And it definitely helps if you remember the story going in, or else watch with captions.

7/10
