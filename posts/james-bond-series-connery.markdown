**1) _Dr. No_ (11.27.20)**

Kind of corny, but also pretty cool. Has that 1960s feel that makes it feel a bit boring and slow, but not really the fault of the movie itself.

The music is immediately iconic, and Sean Connery is quite a handsome man.

7/10

**2) _From Russia With Love_ (12.06.20)**

Better in almost every way than Dr. No. The espionage was more exciting and silly, the chases were more spectacular, the dialogue was funnier, and even the Bond Girl was sexier. The exotic locations weren't as impressive, but there was still a fair bit of eye-candy on that front.

Some parts are clearly unnecessary, like the gypsy clapper dance and the two girls catfighting. I don't hold it against it very much though.

8/10

**3) _Goldfinger_ (12.12.20)**

This one goes above and beyond the previous two, and it fully deserves its iconic status. Nearly every scene had me giggling with delight. This is pretty much everything I'd hope for a James Bond movie to be, and I honestly fear that I won't like any of the other Sean Connery films as much as this one.

The only conceivable complaint I could have is that the final fight with Oddjob is a little light on the drama, but that's easily made up for by the atomic bomb waiting to go off behind them the whole time.

10/10
