**1) _Dr. No_ (11.27.20)**

Kind of corny, but also pretty cool. Has that 1960s feel that makes it feel a bit boring and slow, but not really the fault of the movie itself.

The music is immediately iconic, and Sean Connery is quite a handsome man.

7/10

**2) _From Russia With Love_ (12.06.20)**

Better in almost every way than Dr. No. The espionage was more exciting and silly, the chases were more spectacular, the dialogue was funnier, and even the Bond Girl was sexier. The exotic locations weren't as impressive, but there was still a fair bit of eye-candy on that front.

Some parts are clearly unnecessary, like the gypsy clapper dance and the two girls catfighting. I don't hold it against it very much though.

8/10

**3) _Goldfinger_ ()**
