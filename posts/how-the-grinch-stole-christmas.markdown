It's obnoxious, but I have a soft spot for it. Jim Carrey does a perfect "I'm 10 and so lol XD random" performance. Taylor Momsen is beyond adorable.

I never caught the keys-in-fishbowl joke before this watch.

Ron Howard's directing style is bat-crap crazy. The camera is spinning or dutch-angled in every scene, it seems like. Also everything looks weirdly fake and realistic all at once, and with hardly any noticeable CGI. It's a real aesthetic.

8/10
