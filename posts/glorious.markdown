The perfect example of "it's good, but."

I don't know why people insist on using bad CGI when they could just use bad puppets instead, at least some of the time. It makes the movie look cheaper than it needs to.

I think the core story is good, and the mixture of seriousness and humor is nice. I'm not totally sure how I feel about the ambiguity of what was the reason for Wes and Brenda breaking up, it leads you to believe that he was some kind of serial killer, or at least someone truly rotten inside, based on what the god says at the end.

I think it could actually be a shorter movie and would benefit a little from it. For example looking at the story at a high level, there's a lot of time spent just showing that Wes is resistant to the situation and trying to escape. At the time it feels right, but once you know what the movie is really going for, it feels more like going through the motions of, "well this is what this kind of stock horror movie character would normally do," even though it's not really important in this movie. Also the trucker woman is totally superfluous.

Now that I'm a reasonably well-adjusted adult with a family and a strong faith, I am seeing less and less the appeal of the frame of mind that leads one to write and create such bleak cosmic-justice stories. I don't think that means the movie is bad just because it didn't vibe with me, but I do think I'd be more impressed with the themes and ending as a more impressionable high schooler or college student.

I was afraid that after the joke about the glory hole passed, the movie would lose its sense of purpose and forward momentum, but luckily it did not.

I really like the artwork of the graffiti on the bathroom stall. Also the written graffiti is pretty funny whenever the camera lingers long enough for me to read it.

J.K. Simmons is a national treasure. The role of the god would probably fall flat on its face if it weren't voiced by him. His delivery is simultaneously elevated and casual in a way I just love.

7/10
