This was a pretty good movie. I liked the slow pace of the story, the small main cast, and the scenery and music.

The story is simple enough to feel like it's representative of something greater, but it's trickled out in such small doses that there's still some dramatic tension while you're watching it. I read the story to be about the contradictions in the old-West American ideal. There is a definite contrast between Phil's homosexuality and his cowboy ruggedness and rudeness, and since I know the movie was directed by a Kiwi, I can't help but see the overall themes as representing a critical look at American Western masculinity. But in the end, I don't think Phil simply gets what he deserved, nor do I think Peter is a sociopath. The feeling is more of sadness, that these character dramas have played out the way they have.

One little scene that definitely feels evocative and symbolic, is the exchange of the rawhides for the Indian gloves. If you see the rawhides as a sign of Phil's grip on power (he wants to burn them rather than let anyone else have them), then the gloves that Rose receives in exchange could be seen as his more vulnerable side which he suppresses. Rose comments that they are "so soft" and it's hard to see some kind of meaning in the fact that such a gruesome process of skinning a cow leads to such a tender item of human craftwork.

All that being said, I did not have much of an emotional connection to the characters or the art of the film, which is partly why it doesn't strike me as a great film, but only a good one. I wonder how much of that comes from having watched it with a small audience (wife and mother-in-law). I always seem to get more reflective thought out of solo movie-watching experiences, as opposed to watching something with family or friends.

Also, how weird is it that Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst are again playing a quaint married couple? I think Jane Campion watched season two of _Fargo_ and just went with it without being too self-conscious. I guess they do have a good chemistry on-screen.

7/10
