        <p>We watched these out of chronological order, because honestly the order doesn’t matter for The Muppets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Muppet Treasure Island</em> (02.06.21)</strong></p>
<p>I have a deep loving attachment to this movie. It’s surprisingly dark and edgy for a G-rated kids flick, with multiple mentions of “hell” and lots of violence and loud scary pirate guys. And upon watching it as a twentysomething, I noticed a ton of jokes that I didn’t catch when I was younger. The songs are top-notch, especially “Professional Pirate” which is one of my favorite musical songs ever, I think.</p>
<p>10/10</p>
<p><strong><em>The Muppet Movie</em> (03.12.21)</strong></p>
<p>There’s something magical about the Muppets that’s really evident in this movie, especially during the songs. “The Rainbow Connection” is such a heartbreakingly nostalgic song, even for people who have never heard it, and the amount of gentle focus the movie gives to it right at the beginning is wonderful. Later, the song “I’ll Go Back There Someday” really took my breath away. Gonzo singing such a moving song, in the middle of the desert with the gang, is a really surreal experience. It made me realize that if I were not an American, and I was just learning about the Muppets through this movie, I would be gobsmacked by that scene. It’s really bizarre that marionette-puppets can be so real and emotionally powerful, especially one that’s a self-professed “whatever” species. If the Muppets weren’t so famous and beloved, this would rank as one of the weirdest movie moments of the 70s. And the final rainbow showing up at the end is just awesome.</p>
<p>This movie also feels very much from the 1970s. None of the celebrity cameos are cute the way they are in later movies, they’re funny as heck but there’s a messiness and rudeness about them that’s really interesting. I also liked the reliance on non-digital special effects, like having a giant pie hit the car or using forced perspective to make Animal look Giant near the end. Or especially all the scenes where Fozzie is seen driving the car, it really just looks like a puppet is operating the vehicle instead of some remote-control thing or a human sitting under him using the pedals.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
<p><strong><em>The Muppets Take Manhattan</em> (04.04.21)</strong></p>
<p>The plot is fine, the songs are fine, the cameos are fine. But it’s definitely funny.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
