        <p>We watched these out of chronological order, because honestly the order doesn’t matter for The Muppets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Muppet Treasure Island</em> (02.06.21)</strong></p>
<p>I have a deep loving attachment to this movie. It’s surprisingly dark and edgy for a G-rated kids flick, with multiple mentions of “hell” and lots of violence and loud scary pirate guys. And upon watching it as a twentysomething, I noticed a ton of jokes that I didn’t catch when I was younger. The songs are top-notch, especially “Professional Pirate” which is one of my favorite musical songs ever, I think.</p>
