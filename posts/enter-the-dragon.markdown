The best James bond knockoff ever. The villain has a vague criminal enterprise, picks up minions in an underhanded way, keeps women as pets, and even has a missing hand and a fluffy cat. But Bruce Lee is so much better than Bond, because he can handle himself.

The best part is obviously the fight in the weapon room because it shows that Bruce doesn't need a weapon to win. He's surrounded be swords and stuff and he never even thinks to reach for one. The mirror scene afterwards probably goes on a little too long because it's not as tense as the room before the mirrors, but it's still cool.

The movie feels really short, for two different reasons. The first hour-fifteen is weirdly slow but feels like the beginning of the story, and the final half hour feels short because it's nonstop action. So by the end it feels like the fighting should be happening at the halfway mark, when really it's at the three quarters mark already.

The zooms on Bruce's face are so epic, I can totally see why he became a sensation after this movie.

I've known this theme music for years because of the remix in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 for the PS2, so it was really cool to hear the original. Funky stuff, almost more of a blacksploitation theme than a martial arts or spy theme.

8/10
