It's good. Not "best thriller of the 2000s"good, but certainly a solid normie movie for grownups. The end confrontation is just as good as it ought to be. I liked the music and the scenes of driving at night.

The scene when Michael and Arthur are arguing with the baguettes looks totally fake. The focus on the background was off or something.

I still don't understand how Arthur got his hands on memo #229.

8/10
