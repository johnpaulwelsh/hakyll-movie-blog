It's cute. If I watched it as a kid I would 100% adore it, so I get why others feel that way about it. The part that drags for me a little is the second half of the flying scene, and some of the putzing around the house in the beginning. The animation style is very heartwarming and impressive to behold. I got very cheered up when they go to visit the North Pole, that was an honest surprise for me. Its lack of dialogue is a very big strength.

7/10
