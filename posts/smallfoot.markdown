Mostly a throwaway modern kids movie, but with some really prominent surprises.

I didn't realize it had musical elements, and most of the songs were terrible, but the Stonekeeper's rap and James Corden's repurposing of Queen's "Under Pressure" were both shockingly good.

The movie's theme was also hard to pigeonhole. The rebels in the community are asking scientific questions against a friendly but totalitarian system of government, but it's later shown that the unflinching "rules of the stones" were put into place out of legitimate and warranted fear for their own safety. But then the yeti society is constantly being tricked into other superstitions how the sun rises only after hitting a gong, and how exactly does that make their lives safe against human threats? So it's not like the society is totally justified in setting up a system of lies. I don't know man, the internal universe of this film is more complex than I think it needed to be.

Overall it was cute enough. Some of it was legitimately funny, especially some of the slapstick humor.

5/10
