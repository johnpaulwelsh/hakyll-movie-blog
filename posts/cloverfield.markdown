You know how sometimes you watch a horror movie that isn't scary or overtly funny or anything like that, and the only way you can describe it is that it was fun as hell to watch? That's how I felt about _Cloverfield_. I had been intrigued by the movie ever since it came out, but especially after two "sequels" came out that seemed to have nothing to do with the original movie. The jury is still out on those sequels, but I can definitely say _Cloverfield_ is the smart and well-constructed monster movie it sets out to be.

I think this is one of the few times a horror movie premise lived up to its fullest potential. The dialogue and acting have exactly the right amount of realistic improv elements without becoming totally unwatchable. The characters aren't so stupid that I want them to die, nor are they so likable and clever that they lose their authenticity. The beginning of the movie is absolutely perfect, giving us just enough to learn about the characters where we as the audience get their motivations and care about what happens to them.

The visuals and audio feel exactly right given the "found footage" nature of the film. The lighting is murky and diffused, the sound is unbalanced and really overwhelming at times, and the shakiness actually feels like the cameraman is torn between wanting to save his own ass and give a careful documentary of the events happening around him.

I was also really impressed with the special effects. Just the way all the destruction and crowd panic and walking around deserted streets are depicted, feels like it really could have happened that way. And of course the movie could have ruined itself by paying too much attention to the parts where CGI had to do the most heavy lifting, but I think the monsters and explosions are really solid and didn't seem too low-budget (awkward and blobby) or too high-budget (glossy and sterile).

The monster is never given even a whiff of a professional explanation. The military is focused on their plan and their protocols. The main characters set off on a dangerous quest but do it as carefully as possible. Almost every horror film breaks these rules, and thank goodness _Cloverfield_ doesn't. It's all the better for it. This movie is genius.

9/10
