My feelings about this movie are all over the place, but they trend positive.

Good:
The shadows, OMG. Such a great use of shadow. The visual style of this movie is maybe its greatest strength. Pretty much every shot and scene between the kids leaving on the boat and Powell finding them at Mrs. Cooper's house is pure genius. Such compelling imagery. I'd like to specifically call out any shot where someone is going up stairs, it always seems to have been shot at a distance where you can see the whole staircase from the side, and it looks really well composed.

And the music too! Every use of singing is awesome. The song in the opening credits is creepy, the song that Pearl sings on the boat is haunting and actually gave me chills (even though it's obviously a voice double), and the recurring "Everlasting Arms" motif is surprisingly effective.

The kids' acting is pretty good too, although it definitely suffers from the old-movie trend of having the youngest kid deliver really cringey obvious lines like "when is dad coming home?"

I also like Uncle Bertie, who's inclusion in the movie is more complex than it would have been in the hands of a lesser moviemaker. He stops being useful right at the moment that he might make the most difference, because he's a sad old drunk and he's too weak to play the role he's given.

I really really loved the whole sequence where Powell was stalking outside Mrs. Cooper's house. The sight of her sitting in her rocking chair, and then they sing together, oh MAN that's good stuff. It's like out of a dream.

Bad:
Mrs. Spoon and the mother are the most irritating characters by a long shot, because they seem so unrealistic and hackneyed that it almost takes you out of the movie. Mrs. Spoon is such an incessant meddler that I wanted to wring her neck after her very first scene, and she only gets worse as it goes on. And the mother had such an unrealistically fast progression to marrying Powell, that it honestly felt like bad writing instead of what I suspect they were really trying to do, which is to depict things from the perspective of a kid and to fast-forward the mundane stuff.

But but but... even when those characters piss me off most of the time, they are also involved in some of the most compelling scenes in the movie. The mother's testimony at the church service, and her final scene before Powell kills her, are both startling in how compelling and raw they are. And even Mrs. Spoon has a good moment at the end; it honestly looks like she's drunk after the trial ends, which is a nice callback to the cooking sherry that Mr. Spoon sips from earlier. It makes you wonder what happened behind the scenes in their household after she realizes that she was partially responsible for the mother's death.

In the end, I think the movie works best when seen as a symbolic and artistic statement, almost like a fable, and not as a character-driven plot. Often the characters react in ways that don't make logical sense, or are too obvious or "pat", but the characters stay true to the emotional core of what they're doing or saying. For example, Ruby falling in love with Powell after like three minutes makes sense on an emotional or allegorical level in a way that it just doesn't on a realism level. The allegory angle comes fullest when you see John freak out about the circular nature of his father figures being arrested for murder. Throwing the money at Powell doesn't make logical sense, but it makes emotional sense.

In many ways I can't believe this movie was made in the 50s. It's a lot darker than I would have expected from this time period, especially because there are children involved.

8/10
