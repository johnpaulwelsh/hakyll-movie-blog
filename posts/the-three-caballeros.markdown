I have always really liked this movie, and even as an adult I seem to like it a lot. Maybe it's because so much of it is either skits (which are nearly all enjoyable, except for some of the Mexico ones near the end), and music videos (of which my favorite is Baia in the Brazil section). Watching Donald get his ass handed to him is funny most of the time anyway. I particularly love his fight with the fireworks bull at the end, it's just so triumphant and joyful that I actually got chills as the movie was ending.

I don't want to claim that this movie doesn't have inaccuracies, stereotypes, or Disney-fied elements, but I do get the sense that they're trying to educate me, the viewer, in the culture and naturalia of South and Central America. The fact that so much time is dedicated to just watching smiling men and women dancing and singing makes me suspect the attitude is totally respectful.

8/10
