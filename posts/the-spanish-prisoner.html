        <p>First things first - the dialogue was absurd. Barely 10 minutes into the movie and I was thinking, “Nobody talks like this!” I got used to it of course, so it isn’t too much of a distraction, and it does feel very play-y, which is appropriate given the director and writer is David Mamet.</p>
<p>Second, talk about a slow burn. It felt like 45 minutes went by before any scene felt particularly important. Not boring per-se, but definitely lacking in forward direction. But as the story started falling into place, I realized that everything I had seen in the first act was important, and my mind was racing for the whole second half of the film. There were some parts that I guessed ahead of time which made me suspicious that I might have outsmarted the plot. Luckily they saved some really good twists for the finale, which set things right back on course.</p>
<p>As far as movie elements like acting, framing, and editing go, everything seemed perfectly serviceable; everything subservient to the plot, so they didn’t stand out too much. Granted, the story was pulled off very well so that means the acting, framing, and editing were probably much better than they appear. It’s like a magic trick - the setup has to be so good that it blends in and becomes forgettable, for the trick to really become special.</p>
<p>Last note - when Ross kisses Ricci outside the airport and she looks up and says, “Crikey!” Top-tier screenwriting right there.</p>
