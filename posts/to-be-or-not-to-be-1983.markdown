Starts really slow and corny, but once the impersonations begin it becomes a pretty enjoyable farce. The cast was pretty great, especially Charles Durning.

The attempts to put in little serious moments didn't really work, like the crying old woman refugee or the gay dresser being detained.

My hazy memory of the _1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die_ book entry for the original of this movie said something like, "the Mel Brooks remake is heavy on gags but misses the urgency and emotion of what the characters are trying to accomplish." I think that's exactly right, but it doesn't mean this new one is bad. It just means the original movie is objectively better, even if I enjoyed them about the same.

7/10
