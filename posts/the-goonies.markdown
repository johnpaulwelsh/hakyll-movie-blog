Watched it a theatre with friends, what a treat. One of the funniest movies of the 1980s. When you're really paying attention to every line of dialogue, it's amazing how much of it makes me laugh. One thing I thought about this time is that the group of kids who I think of as the "main cast" is not limited to the young kids, or the young kids plus one older kid. Every kid who goes in to that restaurant is a Goonie, and it's amazing that I have such fond feelings and memories for all seven Goonies. _Reservoir Dogs_ can't get away with that, they kill off two members of the gang to make it easy on themselves in that movie.

The scenes on the pirate ship after the Fratellis show up kind of drag a little in terms of pacing, but I don't care. Iconic film.

10/10
