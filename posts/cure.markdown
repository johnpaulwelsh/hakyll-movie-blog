A very creepy movie, and I can see why it has such a stellar reputation. It's clear that Kiyoshi Kurosawa and his team put a lot of thought and care into the creation of this movie. Every scene cut that's a little too fast, every sound effect that's amplified, and especially every time the camera goes handheld, it all accumulates into a sense of dread which I don't often feel during a movie.

The movie simultaneously gives a fair amount of detail about hypnosis, without every sensationalizing it as the means of instigating the murders. A lesser movie would have made it this big boogeyman, like an _X-Files_ episodes might lean in on "he studied psychology until it broke his brain and he became obsessed with this occult figure Mesmer". But it's left much more open here.

The murderer is so annoying with his endless questions that when he starts talking more intelligently, you really sit up and pay attention. There's a little bit of Clarice and Hannibal going on with the detective and the murderer, but it feels fresh and unpredictable.

I want to give this a 9, but I feel like there's still soemthing about the movie I didn't "get," especially in terms of the big abandoned building and the last 20 minutes. I don't know why I feel like I need to get something to a certain degree to be able to heap big praise upon it.

8/10
