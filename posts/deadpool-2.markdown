In some ways I liked it better than the first _Deadpool_, but it still didn't rise above the line of "pretty good" for me.

The problem I had with first movie was that, for all the crazy jokes, the plot is fairly traditional for an origin movie. In _Deadpool 2_ the plot is a lot less generic, but it's not that interesting on its own either. I don't know what Deadpool's adventures in the comics are normally like, but this movie feels kind of low-risk. And given that the main plot is a ripoff of _The Terminator_, I was surprised that Deadpool only makes one joke along those lines. Considering how many shots are fired against the writers for doing lazy or unfair things in the rest of the movie (like killing his girlfriend before the opening credits roll), I was disappointed that attitude didn't apply to everything.

As for the pros, the acting is great overall. The kid who plays Russell was great, and Josh Brolin is appropriately humorless as Cable. The team that Deadpool assembles was a highlight for me, especially Domino who cracked me up with how totally confident she is at any point in a crazy fight scene.

I must say though, _Deadpool 2_ is the perfect example of an action movie inducing "destruction fatigue," which is something I began feeling around the time of _Age of Ultron_ onward. The big fight scenes involve a tremendous amount of destruction, and after a while I became completely numb to it. Especially because the plot was low-risk compared to something like _Captain America: Civil War_, it felt totally unnecessary for the car chase scene to cause so much mayhem, for example. I feel like fewer things were destroyed in _Civil War_ than in this, and that's a much more important movie to the overall Marvel universe. Even when the action is good (see: anything involving Domino), it was just exhausting to watch after a while.

Finally, I think there were sometimes too many pop-culture references, especially near the beginning. It gave me war flashbacks to _Ted_, which thought that a Taylor Lautner joke would go over well in 2012 and gave me a cringe-induced heart attack back then. _Deadpool 2_ isn't nearly as bad with stuff like that, but I was hoping for more general zaniness and less _Family Guy_-ing.
