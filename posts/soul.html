        <p>Pixar is really damn good at making movies that pull at obvious heartstrings, but do it in such a lovely way that you don’t feel like you’ve been manipulated. It’s also really really funny, which I feel like hasn’t been the case in a Pixar movie since maybe <em>Up</em>.</p>
<p>Watching this after I’ve become a father has ruined me, simply the idea of all those little souls waiting to be born made me so happy and sentimental.</p>
<p>A little thing, but finally a movie captures what it feels like right after the high point of your life, as normal life starts settling back in (this is when Gardner takes the subway home after the gig). And they nailed it.</p>
<p>And I went that whole dang movie not knowing it was Tina Fey. Good for her.</p>
<p>10/10</p>
