        <p>I didn’t really know what to expect from this one, given that its reputation is close to being “best American Western of all time”. I thought the movie would try to make some moral statement about Ethan being a product of the West who has lost his decency and humanity, or something. But it turned out to be a much more normal story, with a lot of non-story thrown in as a way to paint a portrait.</p>
<p>Now I’m starting to think of it as a snapshot of life and strife in the West, captured through the plot device of two men looking for a missing girl. It has it all, really - quirky side characters, double-crossers, romance, violence, comedy, tragedy, and man vs. nature excitement. I’m not so sure that all the elements contributed to the story equally well, but I might just need to let go of my assumptions about there being some kind of profound.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t really buy that Debbie wanted to come home when Marty came to rescue her the second time. I thought it would have been a poignant ending if the search ended successfully but didn’t result in the actual rescue.</p>
<p>I do think the craft of the movie is excellent, though. The recurring theme of doorframes was really compelling, even if I’m not quite sure what it signifies each time it shows up. The music and the scenery were equally good.</p>
<p>Maybe the best thing about the film is that it led me to better appreciate just how uniquely American the Western genre is.</p>
