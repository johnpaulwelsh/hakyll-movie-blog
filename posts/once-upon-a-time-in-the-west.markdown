So obviously a masterpiece, that it's hard to believe the movie even exists. So many cool scenes, so much evocative imagery, and so much "America." And written by a gang of Italians no less!

Every action taken by every character has almost a mythical quality to it. Revenge, dreams, grief, ambition, money, they're all here.

Somehow the movie has both qualities of "could easily fall asleep to" and "insists on drawing and keeping your attention."

Back in the 60s they weren't afraid to have endless long-shots of actors' faces. Even if I knew Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda very well from previous work, their presence as themselves would melt away during that final showdown between them in this movie. In that scene, they stop being actors, and legends stand in their place.

I didn't quite get what happened with the man in the train, why his whole posse was shot-up near the end. I assume it had to do with Cheyenne's injury, but I can't place the chronology in my head.

I once heard that this movie is kind of like a knowing send-off to the genre of the Western, like it's a distillation of everything the genre has to offer. I totally am on board with that idea.

Morricone was 100% on board with the idea. His music sounds like a great Western soundtrack, but also like the soundtrack to a triumphant achievement in the real world, like an Olympic ceremony.

10/10
