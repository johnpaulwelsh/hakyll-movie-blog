Based on the two films I've seen by David Cronenberg, I sense a pattern of his themes being "disturbing personal tragedy." This one has it almost more than _The Fly_. The music by Howard Shore really helps emphasize the tragedy side of it, it's very pretty but melancholy and dramatic.

I think the movie is mostly well done, but I didn't like it all that much. At first it was because I disliked every character - they're all so broken and misguided at the beginning as it is, that I almost lost interest in their character dramas. But as the film went on, my discomfort stopped being tinted with "this is bad" and became more like "this is good but man does it make me feel icky to watch." The despairing and destructive mood that it embodies the whole film is not what I usually want out of a movie experience. It's certainly effective though, and obviously I've enjoyed films like this in the past (_Dancer in the Dark_ for example).

The trajectory of the characters' paths in life is a gentle slope downhill at a constant, almost invisible, pace. By the time it's halfway through the movie I was asking myself, Why is Beverly so messed up again? I feel like it just kind of evolved without me noticing. And then the same thing happens with Elliot, in an almost more imperceptible way. By the end, the characters are almost unrecognizable, which I think is entirely intentional because there's also a sense of mistaken (or lost) identity as it nears the end.

I still don't really get the motivation behind each of their's decline into madness though. It almost feels like they are destined to both slide down into the mire, but whatever actually drives Beverly to drug addiction, obsession, and despair is almost too vague. For Elliot it's easier to understand, both at a plot level and more of a thematic level. Especially once they bring up the Siamese twins idea, it becomes more clear what's going on.

I've now concluded that disturbing domestic turmoil hidden in apartment units is one of my existential fears. Just thinking about someone having to enter the apartment and find the bloody mess that it's become, it really creeps me out.

This movie made me fairly squeamish at times, even with nothing graphic shown, but what should I have suspected after learning it was about gynecologists and directed by Cronenberg?

I could spot all of the tricks they used to make Jeremy Irons play two characters in the same scenes. But even still, it's an impressive acting and directing feat that I became so convinced of these two guys being different characters despite that.

5/10
