Based on the two films I've seen by David Cronenberg, I sense a pattern of his themes being "disturbing personal tragedy." This one has it almost more than _The Fly_. The music by Howard Shore really helps emphasize the tragedy side of it, it's very pretty but melancholy and dramatic.

I think the movie is well done, but I didn't like it all that much. At first it was because I disliked every character - they're all so broken and misguided at the beginning as it is, that I almost lost interest in their character dramas. But as the film went on, my discomfort stopped being tinted with "this is bad" and became more like "this is good but man does it make me feel icky to watch." The despairing and destructive mood that it embodies is not what I usually want out of a movie experience. It's certainly effective though.

The trajectory of the characters' path in life is a gentle slope downhill at a constant, almost invisible, pace. By the time it's halfway through the movie I was asking myself, Why is Beverly so messed up again? I feel like it just kind of evolved without me noticing. And then the same thing happened with Elliot, in an almost more imperceptible way. By the end, the characters are almost unrecognizable, which I think is entirely intentional because there's also a sense of mistaken (or lost) identity as it nears the end.

I've now concluded that disturbing domestic turmoil hidden in apartment units is one of my existential fears.

This movie made me extremely squeamish at times, but what should I have suspected after learning it was about gynecologists and directed by Cronenberg? Nice way to un-horny myself though - I don't want to have sex ever again.

6/10
