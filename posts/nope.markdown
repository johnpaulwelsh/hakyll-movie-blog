Man that was a cool movie. Maybe it's too ballsy to show the monster so much, but I wasn't bothered in the least because it looks so awesome.

The themes of cameras, sight, and wild animals is pretty interesting, but doesn't overwhelm the movie and make it too abstract. Ultimately it's a really cool alien/monster movie which is legitimately exciting and spectacular. But the TMZ guy who is obsessed with capturing things on camera really feels like a hilarious and on-the-nose example of the theme.

I like that the music becomes more and more western-influenced as the movie went on, and as it becomes less sci-fi and more just action.

I'm really glad the director got to shoot in IMAX so much, it's really amazing footage. Probably in my top five movies that I regret most not seeing in a theater.

There are some awesome little set dressings, my favorite of which is when Emerald wakes up in the bed and there's a cowboy hat hanging slanted on a clothestree which makes it look like the alien looking right at her. Also at the very end when the little pointing wooden sign of the Asian guy is pointing at OJ through the gate.

9/10
