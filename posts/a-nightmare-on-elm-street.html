        <p><em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> is simply a fantastic horror movie. I kind of assumed that it would be kinda trashy and gross and not scary at all, because that’s how I imagine a lot of “classic” horror movies are for some reason. But actually it’s really smart, exciting, and fun.</p>
<p>I already talked to my friend Rob about the film so I don’t have a lot of concrete thoughts to put in this post. So here is a bullet list of thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fred Kreuger is hilarious, and his stretchy-arms in his first major scene are the funniest thing I’ve seen in a while.</p></li>
<li><p>Tina is a jerk and has the best death scene ever.</p></li>
<li><p>Nancy is one of my favorite horror protagonists ever. She’s smart, funny, and adorable.</p></li>
<li><p>The dream sequences in the first half are legitimately creepy at times, especially the one in school.</p></li>
<li><p>The music is so 80s I can’t even handle it.</p></li>
<li><p>I didn’t even notice which character was Johnny Depp until I looked up the cast list. I’m still in disbelief.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>9/10</p>
