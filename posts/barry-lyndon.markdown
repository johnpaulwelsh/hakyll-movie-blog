*At intermission*

What a slow burn. I went from appreciating the scenery but finding the story very dull, to having a grin on my face for many long stretches at a time. The music that plays when he's impersonating an English officer is hilariously pompous compared to the quaint Irish melodies that come before.

This movie is almost like _How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying_ or _Catch Me If You Can_, but more like, "world's greatest screw-up accidentally works his way up to king of Europe." So I guess _Forrest Gump_ is a better comparison.

The candle-lit scenes deserve their good reputation.

*After intermission*

A very effective tragedy.

I was amazed by the duel scene in the barn. Kubrick really knows how to milk a long scene for all the drama that can be gotten from it. I actually gasped when Lord Bullington's shot goes off, and then again when Barry fires into the ground. It's like an entire conversation happens between the men, and between Barry's past and present self, without any words.

The language of the narration is beautiful.

9/10
