        <p>I always remembered this movie has having a surprisingly dark story, and I’m glad to see I was right upon rewatch.</p>
<p>I’ll admit the songs are pretty catchy, and it’s all very wholesome and friendly even when there’s blatant child abuse and forced labor as integral elements of the story.</p>
