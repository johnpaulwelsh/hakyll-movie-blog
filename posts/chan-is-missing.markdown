I love the mix of styles, how it sometimes feels like a documentary, or a pseudo-doc, or semi-improvised, or neo-noir, or just a slice of life comedy. I especially love the dramatic music when Joe feels like he's being followed, and the way that the camera drifts over to the American western on the TV while Joe is talking to Chan's wife.

I think the film is pretty up-front about its themes of national and cultural identity, which makes me want to dock points for being too obvious about it. But I enjoyed the voiceover narration so much, and I don't think I would necessarily pick up the themes as strongly if they weren't spelled out for me in the narration. So I guess I don't actually have a complaint.

I certainly liked it more than _The Joy Luck Club._ I also liked how it does minority Americans talking about how members of their group always act, oh that's so ___ or he's not ___ enough, compared to _Smoke Signals_ which does the same thing but (I think) in a more annoying way.

8/10
