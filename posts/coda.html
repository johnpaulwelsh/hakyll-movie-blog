        <p>Very very good, a true crowd pleaser. The rare movie about a senior in high school where I don’t get mad at the teenager for making bone-headed decisions (looking at you, <em>Lady Bird</em>). If anything, I was annoyed at the parents most often out of anyone in the film.</p>
<p>A perfect mixture of humor, heart, and drama. I really appreciate the brotherly perspective from Leo, and it is refreshing to see a parental couple who are crazy about each other, but not totally irresponsible and immature.</p>
<p>One nitpick on the story: how did Ruby talk funny when she entered high school, if she presumably went to K-8th grade and learned how to talk then? It’s not as if she was homeschooled until high school, because I seriously doubt a culturally-mute child could learn to sing and pronounce American English in four years to the proficiency she has.</p>
<p>This movie will go down in history as one of the greats for two scenes in particular: when Ruby explains how singing makes her feel using ASL only, and when she performs “Both Sides Now” at the end. Just magical. I teared up during the final performance, which of course is supposed to happen, but gosh darn it I did anyway. That song is so beautiful, but seeing her sign along to it pushes it into instant-classic territory.</p>
