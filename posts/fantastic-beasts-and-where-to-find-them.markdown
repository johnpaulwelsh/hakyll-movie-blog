I am officially sick of prequel movies that are more extravagant than their source material, but also have much lower stakes in the grand scheme of things and suffer from weaker stories overall. _The Hobbit_ is a well known offender, but allow me to count _Fantastic Beasts_ in that category as well.

First, the extravagance. Much like in _Deadpool 2_, there is simply too much destruction. Every ten minutes something is exploding or being put back together after an explosion. I'm on the fence about so many things being magically put back together in this movie. Like obviously that happens a lot in the wizarding world, but I think it also cheapens the destruction because no one will have to clean up the mess. At least in the Marvel movies, it remains a background plot point that New Yorkers can't afford all the mayhem and intergalactic fighting in its backyard, but there's no such sense of realism here.

But in my opinion, the movie fails hardest in the story and drama department. When Scamander isn't being the most predictable naturalist in the world (something something humans are the most dangerous creatures of all), everyone else is being equally bland and obvious. Not everybody was terrible (I liked Goldstein and Kowalski), but nobody really stood out to me because of their glowing personality. And I usually don't complain about skin-deep romances in movies that aren't focused on the romance, but Kowalski and the dippy girl had just about the fastest meet-to-kiss acceleration I've ever seen and it felt totally unearned.

Also in trying to make a plot with surprise twists and high-intensity action, I think the screenwriters left in some pretty large inconsistencies. Like after the wizards all blow apart the smoke boy, it seemed like the perfect time for someone to make a big speech about how horrible it was that they did that. But all we get is Scamander getting a little annoyed, and then the laziest plot twist reveal about Grindelwald that they could have cooked up.

All of that being said, I was charmed by the actual beasts. The little Groot, the Thunderbird, the big rhino thing, and even the obvious cash-grab platypus thing were all pretty cool looking and fit well with the existing _Harry Potter_ world.

So yeah, I'm not too interested in seeing the sequel.

4/10
