        <p>False advertising, this has almost nothing to do with the sword in the stone.</p>
<p>This is one of the few movies I can think of that has almost nothing going for it for an adult audience, it’s all for the kids. Low-stakes peril, funny scenes, and whimsy are all here, but they’re attached to the least interesting characters and least compelling plot in almost the entire Disney canon. There’s hardly any reason to watch this once you’re older than 10 or 11.</p>
<p>The scene with the girl squirrel always made me uncomfortable and depressed as a kid. I think it’s a combination of the aggressive flirting, which feels weird to watch when you’re not old enough to be interested in romance yet, and the existential rejection at the end, which made me really sad for poor little girl squirrel.</p>
<p>Archimedes saying “Hoo? What what?” is an instant classic quote.</p>
<p>Merlin only seems to know how to transform Arthur into animals and clean things, some magician he is.</p>
