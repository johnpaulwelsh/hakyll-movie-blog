If this were a western-hemisphere film I'd consider it an incomprehensible fantasy story with confusing logic and sloppy storytelling. For example, doesn't the main character speak a different language than the Buel chief when he first shows up on their land? Then why later on do they seem to speak the same language? Is there a massive time jump during which one of them learns the other's language? Also all of the talk about the impending disaster coming for the Bambara country, that seems to just be vague prophecy because we never see anything to indicate what kind of disaster it is. Are they predicting the European slave trade? Also I was confused about the dialogue which stated that the main character made his uncle vanish in front of everybody. What uncle? The main character only comes to see Djidui after that scene, which is the uncle he was sent to visit. Do they mean the burly guy with the other magic post? He only shows up once and never is seen again in the movie.

As much as it seems like a cop-out or an unfair prejudice, this movie improves in my opinion by being an authentic African tribal story and not a European estimation of an African tribal story. It's pretty amazing to see the footage of this film and imagine that behind it was a cast, a crew, a cameraman, a director, etc. because it feels so authentic and ancient. If you want to call that impressive world building or immersion, then let's call it that.

Believe it or not, my favorite parts are when Soma is praying for the magic post to find his son. There are seemingly an infinite number of long scenes where he's just babbling mystic nonsense, invoking seemingly every natural force and animal in his prayers to Koma. But I kind of enjoyed that part!

I probably should not have watched it at midnight because it nearly put me to sleep a few times. Maybe that contributes to the feeling I have that the story is confusing and shot through with holes.

So overall I mostly appreciate this as a cultural artifact with really cool natural landscapes and some amusingly verbose magical incantations. As a story, I barely held on to the plot thread, and as a moviemaking craft there was too much stuff that I'd consider sloppy.

Also I'm not usually one to condemn something for period-accurate misogyny, but the women in this story are seriously given the bare minimum importance according to their relationship to the main character. Mother is distant but caring and tells him to leave, and wife is constantly told to wait or leave or come. It's pretty glaring that the women in this story are not the important part.

5/10
