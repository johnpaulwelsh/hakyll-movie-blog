Very very good, a true crowd pleaser. The rare movie about a senior in high school where I don't get mad at the teenager for making bone-headed decisions (looking at you, _Lady Bird_). If anything, I was annoyed at the parents most often out of anyone in the film.

A perfect mixture of humor, heart, and drama. I really appreciate the brotherly perspective from Leo, and it is refreshing to see a parental couple who are crazy about each other, but not totally irresponsible and immature.

One nitpick on the story: how did Ruby talk funny when she entered high school, if she presumably went to K-8th grade and learned how to talk then? It's not as if she was homeschooled until high school, because I seriously doubt a culturally-mute child could learn to sing and pronounce American English in four years to the proficiency she has.

This movie will go down in history as one of the greats for two scenes in particular: when Ruby explains how singing makes her feel using ASL only, and when she performs "Both Sides Now" at the end. Just magical. I teared up during the final performance, which of course is supposed to happen, but gosh darn it I did anyway. That song is so beautiful, but seeing her sign along to it pushes it into instant-classic territory.

10/10
