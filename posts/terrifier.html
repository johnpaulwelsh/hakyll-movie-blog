        <p>I’ve already seen this story twice, as a short film on YouTube and as the final segment of the first <em>All Hallows Eve</em>. So what’s it like when stretched out to a feature length?</p>
<p>Well for starters, it’s an original story that could easily be a sequel. Which is kind of a relief because I didn’t think the original story could have been improved. Otherwise, it’s actually kinda just okay.</p>
<p>There are some nice surprises which usually come from scenes dragging on a little longer than you expect them to, so the jump scare comes late enough where you almost forget about it. And the spot where Art and the crazy lady were interacting was surprising, even though it ends up that nothing deeper was going on and he killed her anyway.</p>
<p>The gruesomeness is really just saved for the one killing, everything else was thankfully not interested in lingering on the gore for too long.</p>
<p>I think I’ll continue to watch any further entries in the Art the Clown Cinematic Universe (ACCU), but mostly because I like the idea of art more than I like any individual thing he’s in. You gotta love that he listens to freako jazz in the truck, and honks his horn and rides a minibike at the least appropriate times.</p>
<p>Also I’m still confused about the beginning scene. I thought they said it was a highway killing that the woman was involved in, but apparently the ending proves it occurred after the events of this movie. But in that case, what’s the point in Vicky killing the interview host? It just kinda seems lazy to me.</p>
