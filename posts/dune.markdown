Movies like this often have a specific vibe of, "there's some story happening, partially in the background, that you don't know because you didn't read the book, and here's a boring depiction of those events with only just enough context to make it make sense. But your friend who read the book next to you will be annoyed that it's so surface level, and you will always feel like something important was left out." I think the first hour of this movie feels a little like that, but once it becomes a more conventional desert-planet story it stands on its own feet a lot better.

There are still some moments like that, or at least things that feel arbitrary because they either weren't explained with clear dialogue or were explained too long ago to stick in your memory. The prophecy thing that Jessica and her coven are talking about is one of them, and the fight at the end with the desert warrior is another.

Overall though, I was sincerely awed by the scenery and effects and action, and I'm looking forward to part two when Paul becomes Sand Jesus and rides a worm.

8/10
