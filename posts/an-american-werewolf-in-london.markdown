What a fantastic movie. Really funny, but also a proper werewolf horror movie. The personalities of David and his friend are great to watch, both before and after the friend becomes a walking corpse. It also manages to squeeze in a pretty satisfying "sexy nurse" fantasy, because Alex is one hot chick. David running around naked at the zoo is a personal favorite scene of mine. The ending is pretty much perfect because of how blunt and no-nonsense it is. It takes kind of a long time to get to "David is a werewolf" scenes, but the pacing makes more sense when taking the movie as a whole after it's finished.

The song choices of only songs with "moon" in the title is almost lame, but ends up working. The Princess Diana congratulations in the credits is pretty weird too.

They use literally the same makeup style as in _Fright Night_, and maybe even _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. But I'm sure it was innovative at the time.

9/10
