        <p>I am ignoring all differences between the film and the books, because I never read any of them. My wife filled me in after the fact on the major differences but it did not impact my opinion.</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of a poorly-developed blockbuster fantasy movie that leaves absolutely no impression on the viewer. The only part that seemed well-defined was the society structure of the fairy world. But everything else was sloppy and half-baked.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t believe for a second that Artemis was a genius, other than I was told he was.</li>
<li>The little black girl who shows up doesn’t actually do anything useful.</li>
<li>The antagonist is totally empty, might as well not exist.</li>
<li>It seemed like Artemis’s absent father would be a major influence on his characterization, but it’s completely thrown out as soon as it’s established.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think a bunch of the movie could have been improved by making one simple change - making Artemis the narrator instead of the dwarf guy. It would give a lot more insight into the personality of the main character, and it would make the story a lot less “telly” and more “showy”.</p>
<p>At least it isn’t as bad as the <em>Death Note</em> movie.</p>
<p>3/10</p>
