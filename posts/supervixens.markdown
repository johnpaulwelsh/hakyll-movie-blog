Some of the dialogue is hilarious, especially from Angel in the beginning and at the very end. But lots of this movie is actually kind of boring, or else drags on too long. The climactic scene in the desert is pretty entertaining, even though you're hearing Vixen yell and scream the whole time and it's very distracting. I wish more was done with the supernatural connection between Angel and Vixen, that part seemed very proto-Lynchian. Actually lots of this movie seems like a first draft of _Twin Peaks: The Return_ combined with _Wild at Heart_, not in terms of plot necessarily, but due to the lurid desert action and weirdo characters, combined with some notable set pieces (fire on the mountaintop, motels, double role for the leading lady, etc.).

It's funny that Harry wants to take them out fishing in the middle of the desert, and we never get to see the bait and tackle shop that is promised by that sign.

For a movie that seems misogynistic on the surface, the men actually make off pretty terribly as well. It's just goofballs playing in the desert and everybody sucks.

There are definitely some notable boobs in this here movie.

5/10
