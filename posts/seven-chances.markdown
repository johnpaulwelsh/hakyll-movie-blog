My third Buster Keaton movie and they've just gotten better and better, this one being the best so far. I love that it's funny and sweet for most of the runtime without any stunts, but with a lot of physical comedy in the non-stunt categories. But then the stunts are awesome too! I was just so tickled by seeing all those women chase Buster around seemingly the whole state of California. The music in this one was particularly good, Robert Israel is obviously a silent film scoring genius.

10/10
