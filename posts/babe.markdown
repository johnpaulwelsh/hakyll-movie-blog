As a kid I guess I never formed an opinion of this movie, but I must have also watched it a lot because remnants of the music and dialogue were unlocked in my brain while watching this as an adult for the first time.

It's just delightful. A fair amount of dark stuff, and a good amount of adults acting cartoonishly mean or bad or dumb like what happens in many kids movies. But the core story is just too cute and wholesome.

I am just so impressed that the movie got made at all. Like, every scene either has a real live animal with CGI mouths (very well trained!) or a freakishly convincing puppet/animatronic.

9/10
