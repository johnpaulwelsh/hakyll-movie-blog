I had already seen something called _Terrifier_ twice, as a short film on YouTube and as the final segment of the first _All Hallows Eve_. So what's it like when stretched out to a feature length?

Well for starters, it's an original story that could easily be a sequel, and not just a dragged-out retelling of the same story. Which is kind of a relief because I didn't think the original story could have been improved. Otherwise, this movie is actually kinda just okay.

There are some nice surprises which usually come from scenes dragging on a little longer than you expect them to, so the jump scare comes late enough where you almost forget about it. And the spot where Art and the crazy lady are interacting is surprising, even though it ends up that nothing deeper is going on and he kills her anyway.

The lion's share of gruesomeness is really just saved for one killing, everything else is thankfully not interested in lingering on the gore for too long.

I think I'll continue to watch any further entries in the Art the Clown Cinematic Universe (ACCU), but mostly because I like the idea of Art more than I like any individual thing he's in. You gotta love that he listens to freako jazz in the truck, and honks his horn and rides a minibike at the least appropriate times.

Also I'm still confused about the beginning scene. I thought they said it was a highway killing that the woman was involved in, but apparently the ending proves it occurred after the events of this movie. But in that case, what's the point in Vicky killing the interview host? It just kinda seems lazy to me.

6/10
