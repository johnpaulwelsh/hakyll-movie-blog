There are some good bits here, but overall it feels pretty light on intrigue and much of the movie is kinda dull. I'm sure if I had seen Argento's filmography in order I would appreciate this more, but with the knowledge that he later made _Deep Red_ I can only see this as proto-Argento.

The music is pretty good, the whole painting angle is interesting, and the painter himself is hilarious. And I absolutely love the scene when the main guy goes into the killer's apartment and the lights are out.

But the twist is kinda lame, or at least feels a little obvious once you realize that the rich man couldn't have been the only killer.

Everything in this movie is done better in _Cat o' Nine Tails_ and/or _Deep Red_.

6/10
