I'm really glad this holds up on a rewatch after all these years. As a teenager, watching them on my parents' DVR recorded off of Spike TV, with content editing and commercials, my little mind was blown. Now that I'm older I pretty much feel the same way as I did then - this movie is so cool. With my better knowledge of Tarantino's modus operandi and genre history, I can see how this is just a mismash of every cool action, kung fu, or revenge flick that Tarantino ever watched, and the goofiness and over-the-top-ness makes more sense in light of the influences.

The dialogue is actually one of my least favorite parts, at least in _Vol 1_. The conversation between Vernita and The Bride in the kitchen drags a little, though that might just be because it's all exposition. Even that might be intentional - crappy action movies from the 70s often have dense exposition in a boring talking scene. Therefore the long stretch of movie where there's basically no talking, that being the entire chapter "Showdown at House of Blue Leaves", is clearly the best part of the film. I don't mind how drawn-out some of the long tracking shots are, it's just so dang cool.

Speaking of that chapter, I don't get the complaint about the black and white "censorship" during the bloodiest parts of fighting. It'd be nice to see it once in full color, but I think the transition to B&W (eye pulled out) and back again to color (The Bride blinking) are some of the most startling instances of "this is cool" in the whole movie.

The 4K disc looks great to me, I literally don't know what people are talking about when they talk about "smearing" in the picture.

10/10
