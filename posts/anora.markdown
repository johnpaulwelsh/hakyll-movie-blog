I am so terribly conflicted about this movie. I laughed, I was on the edge of my seat about what would happen in the end, and I certainly got aroused. But for 99% of the film I didn't feel comfortable with the movie because I couldn't tell how I should be feeling about the character of Ani. Is it about how great being young and stupid is? No because Ivan really gets what's coming to him in the end. Is it about how maturity and severity are the most important thing? No because Ivan's parents and by extension Tolos are pretty horrible and pathetic too. Is it about empowerment for Ani, to tell off all these losers who keep tossing her around? No to that too, because she doesn't seem like she leaves with her dignity intact. For 99% of the movie I couldn't tell what the film's opinion is of sex work. Is it supportive? Does it glamourize it? Does it look down on it?

All of these conflicting feelings made every part feel tainted somehow. The sexy and exciting stuff in the beginning is uncomfortable because I don't think human dignity is maintained in the lifecycle of sex, drugs, and partying. The bumbling comedy of the middle is uncomfortable because the powers fighting against that hedonistic lifestyle are clearly dirtbags too, just the rich and powerful kind.

The only constant throughout is that I thought Igor was clearly the most human thing to hold on to. He's funny, he's sincere, he's kind of unpredictable, and most importantly he treats Ani like she's a person.

So that's why the 1%, the very last scene, is so mind-bending to me. Because this pays off all of those uncomfortable feelings all at once in an overwhelming way. Ani is broken, and the events of this film take her past her breaking point. The only person who shows her human compassion and personal interest, and her poor addled brain somehow comes up with the idea to have sex with him, but refuse his kiss. It's really a heartbreaking movie when you really digest that last scene. But I think it's sadder than Sean Baker thinks it is, because I refuse the supposition that sex work is a dignified and legitimate form of employment in the first place. I think Ani is stuck between "faking it" and "surviving" for the entire movie, and only in her interactions with Igor are her defenses lowered. Obviously that's the point of the ending. But I don't think the trauma of her marriage and subsequent forced annulment are the only thing she's processing, it's also that she only got into this mess because sex employment inherently is an emotionally manipulative profession, where everbody suffers.

So the ending is brilliant, moreso than the director intended I think. But did I need all of that movie leading up to it? That's why I am still so conflicted. It's the most extreme example I've seen of showing us one thing and meaning another, but only revealing the meaning at the very very end. Is the sympathy and human emotion that comes through in the finale, worth the exploitation that precedes it?

6/10
