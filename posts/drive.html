        <p>I think this movie mostly lives up to its reputation as a moody, sleek post-action movie, but I think the potential shown in the first half is wasted a little and the film becomes too much of a conventional action flick by the end.</p>
<p>In the early scenes it was so cool to be able to read emotions, thoughts, and motivations in the faces of the characters. Some of the best acting and directing work I’ve seen in a while. But as it went on, I felt like I was getting less and less nuance out of Gosling’s face, and by the end his motivation didn’t matter the way it did when Standard was still alive. It never quite got as generic as “I’m doing it for the girl and kid, that’s it” because he did feel some kind of loyalty and friendship toward Standard, who didn’t express quite enough animosity to be a real enemy. But it was close.</p>
<p>My favorite parts were when Ryan Gosling was driving, staring, or generally being silent and moody. The more the rest of the story started to pick up, the less engaged I became. Not that the story is bad, only that it became a little too pedestrian compared to what I thought it could be.</p>
<p>The score was amazing, the pulsing moody electronic music really helped carry the movie. But the soundtrack was just okay - I liked the style and it fit the film well, but the lyrics of the songs were occasionally too on-the-nose (the line “and a real heroooooo” was pretty distracting especially). I think it would have worked better if every scene with synthpop songs used instrumentals instead. The scene near the end with the Broadway-style song was perfect though.</p>
