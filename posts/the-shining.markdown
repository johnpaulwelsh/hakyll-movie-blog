This was my 3rd or 4th time seeing this movie, and I've decided it just doesn't work for me.

Too many unintentional funny moments. The credits are lame with the synth music and blue words scrolling upwards. Nicholson's acting is legendary I guess, but also it's kind of ridiculous and takes you out of the movie a lot of the time. He's so menacing and phony even in his first scenes, it doesn't feel like he gets any real character development until he talks to Grady in the bathroom. The title cards of "Friday" and "Tuesday" especially are just funny, and I think only one of them is supposed to be. Nicholson's groggy look after he's knocked unconscious, and his growling/moaning at the end of the hedge maze, are just silly and ruin the mood. And every time it cuts to Dick when he's calling from Florida or traveling to the hotel, it halts the forward momentum significantly. Maybe the shorter cut of the film improves on this.

The story of _The Shining_ is just okay, even in book form, but I'm with Stephen King with thinking that this movie butchered the story and meaning of the book and made something incoherent and meaningless. If there were more of an undercurrent of alcoholism I think they could have left things just as ambiguous as they are now, but it would have felt more meaningful and representative of something. Especially during the first hour I was filling in details that I remembered from the book and it almost made me like the movie more, but only as a way of reminding me how much I liked the book on its own. A similar thing happened with _It Chapter Two_, where my favorite moments of the movie worked to remind me of how much I liked the characters from the book, instead of standing on their own as good scene adaptations.

Technically the movie is pretty good or great, although I think the lack of dark or shadowy scenes definitely makes it way less creepy, not more. There's something very clinical about the scenes in the food storeroom especially, whereas the scenes at the Gold Room bar with the lighting coming up from the bar is amazing.

The sound and music are also usually excellent. The way the strings go totally crazy when the most mundane conversation is happening is a really good directorial choice, even though yet again, it isn't actually creepy at all in my opinion. It's just interesting.

I don't get any of this "the geometry of the hotel is wrong and that leads you to get disoriented." I've never once thought about rooms connect to each other while watching the movie.

Here are the scenes that work for me:

- Family touring the hotel at the beginning
- Jack going in to room 237
- Jack talking to Danny in the bedroom
- Jack talking to Lloyd at the bar
- Jack talking to Grady in the bathroom
- Jack chopping up things with the axe
- The hedge maze at the end

3/10
