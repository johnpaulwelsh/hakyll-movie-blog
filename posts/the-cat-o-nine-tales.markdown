I don't know if the actual mystery aspect of Dario Argento's films gets enough credit. This one has a lot of great misdirections and near the end of the movie I was on the edge of my seat. The motive ended up being pretty interesting too, and not too hard to guess at for those who might want to figure it out before the reveal at the end.

There are some slow parts in the middle, mostly leading up to discovering Braun's dead body, since he was already dead there isn't a lot of excitement in that spot of the movie.

The entire scene in the graveyard and mausoleum are top-tier suspense. I was actually surprised when we see the blind man getting strangled and the reporter got locked in. I had no idea what was going to happen next and the movie really makes you sit and stew in that feeling until the blind guy shows back up. If I were in a movie theater I probably would have cheered at the moment I was sure he wasn't dead.

The ending is excellent too, especially the rooftop chase. I'm so glad they didn't kill the little kid, but I also kind of figured they wouldn't.

I loved the POV camerawork, especially in a scene like the train platform where the camera looks back and forth in such a way where it really feels like a person's eyes moving.

Overall, certainly not as obsessively interesting to watch as _Deep Red_, but definitely still enjoyable.

8/10
