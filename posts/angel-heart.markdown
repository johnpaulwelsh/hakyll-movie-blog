NOTE: I had to watch this across two nights, so the first paragraph is my thoughts before finishing the movie.

So Harry is actually Johnny right? I wonder if they will close the plot hole of the fact that Angel doesn't have amnesia or a mysterious past. I like it so far, even if I turn out to be right about the twist. Maybe a 7/10 thus far. Now that I know the music is Trevor Jones (_Labyrinth_) it's really obvious, there's something uniquely 80s synthy about his work.

I was right, Cyphre is the devil and Harry is Johnny. It's interesting to watch a twist-ending movie for the first time while also being pretty sure of the twist, it lets you see themes and symbolism which normally would confuse you or pass you by.

It's hilarious that Cyphre is more comfortable sitting in the back of a church than Harry is. There's a small comparison drawn between voodoo rituals and the Black church in Brooklyn which is pretty ballsy to draw.

For a movie which seems pretty mainstream, it's actually very effed up and gruesome. But not in a way that I think is inappropriate. Even the incest twist feels right for this kind of sweaty supernatural thriller.

The sex scene with Epiphany (wow what a telling name they gave her!) goes from hot to NOT pretty fast. But since I knew already she was his daughter it was already pretty NOT.

8/10
