A good script, turned into a movie, but that's kind of it. Not many effective instances of filmic art, except for the camera following Thomas into the final courtroom scene. Everything else is just serviceable.

The character performances are all great once the film hits the halfway mark, before that they are a little questionable. Especially Henry VIII - I know at the end they say that he died of syphilis, but are we supposed to glean that that's why he's so bipolar and wacky throughout the movie?

By the way, this is the only film I know of that ends in a "what happened to everybody next" recap that's spoken and not written on the screen. The poor narrator gets like 30 seconds of screen work.

Thomas doesn't jump right into volunteering to be a martyr for the cause of Catholicism. His conversation with his daughter after he walks back home through the night is particularly intriguing. His thesis seems to be that man has the right and the duty to survive and escape peril, so long as it doesn't require going against man's law or God's law. He keeps his mouth diligently shut about the controversy, right up until it's clear that man's law has been thrown out in order to do him in, and only then does he speak outwardly about the matter of the king's divorce, so he can continue to upload God's law.

It raises interesting parallels with the scene of Jesus being tried in the Gospels. Christ also uses cagey language to never outright confirm or deny the accusations levied against him. But those in power abuse their station and force the Pilate's hand, in much the same way that Cromwell and Rich conspire against Thomas.

Side note, there are so many hyper-specific memes that my high school classmates built up about this movie when we watched it in religion class. All the below lines are etched into my memory:

- And you are very gay.
- Seriously?
- But for Wales?
- It's a lion I've married, a lion!
- Employ me! No. EMPLOY ME! No.

7/10
