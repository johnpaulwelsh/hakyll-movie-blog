I get the impression that Coppola and friends set out to make a nightmare recollection of the story of _Dracula_. That's the distinct tone I picked up from this movie, that it represents a nightmare. So much overacting and histrionics (Renfield and Lucy especially), so many bizarre and off-the-wall little details (the CatDog lesbian sisters), and such adventurous camerawork (straight out of _The Evil Dead_ at times). Thus resulting in a movie that has more extremely memorable moments than a lot of recent movies I've seen. I loved the shadowplay they used when Dracula is in his castle, I loved the camera transitions and constant overlaying of one character on top of another's scene to imply a connection. I was also a big fan of the particular sexual bent they put on the story, not scrubbing it up too much or making it too lurid.

It made me uncomfortable how much they emphasized the romance aspect to the story, at least compared to my memory of what happens in the book. I like the parts of the _Dracula_ story where it's demonstrated that he can control people so easily, but it was icky to focus so much time on how much Mina was beholden to his spell. And to be honest, I'm only a little clear on what happened at the end, it seemed a little too much like a happy fuzzy ending tacked on to a more-or-less faithful adaptation of the story.

Phenomenal cast, especially Oldman and Hopkins. Keanu wasn't too bad, but his accent was clearly lacking in authenticity.

Phenomenal music too. I especially liked the chanting they threw in to the score when Dracula was coming to finish off Lucy, it felt off-beat with the rest of the music and it was really unsettling.

8/10
