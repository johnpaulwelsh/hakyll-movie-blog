        <p>Proof that <em>The Dark Knight</em> was kind of a fluke in how perfect it is, but that the trilogy overall is “good” according to a more conventional definition of the term.</p>
<p>The editing during two-person conversations is terrible and sloppy, especially in the first half like when Bruce is talking to Alfred. It almost looks like the editor covered his/her ears when cutting those scenes, and went totally by the appearance of the characters and not at all by the sound of their lines.</p>
<p>The momentum of this movie is amazing, it doesn’t feel nearly as long as it actually is.</p>
<p>Once again, they learn the lesson that Batman’s feelings don’t matter and the less time spent paying attention to them, the better.</p>
<p>The horrifying things happening in Gotham feel less impactful in this movie compared to the previous two. In <em>Batman Begins</em> it’s legitimately scary to unleash the prisoners from Arkham Asylum and poison the air with wacky juice. In <em>The Dark Knight</em> it’s really upsetting and oppressive to see guns going off during parades and the hospital blowing up and the ferry boat scene. But in this, the weightiness of trapping all the cops underground or holding the threat of a nuke over the city’s head just feels… kind of rushed? The human misery is pretty well ignored in this movie compared to the other two, so it’s easier to just be like “okay someone just got shot on screen, that’s gnarly.”</p>
<p>Bane is goofy, let’s be honest. He sounds like a Monty Python character. But every line of dialogue he has is memorable as hell. Or I guess, memed-on is the better phrase.</p>
<p>The twist about Tate is stupid and makes Bane way less menacing. They don’t really explain whether Tate was working with him all along or not, so it makes it seem like he’s just the Mr. Tibbers to her Annie. I can’t believe I just used a League of Legends reference in this review.</p>
