This is one of the few films i've watched recently where there are clearly themes at play in the plot, but it's hard to pin down and seems to evolve over time. The specter of sexuality hovers over this film in such a palpable way, but it takes on a kind of mystical and unreal quality because Tom Cruise's character is always at arm's reach from it. I think when he hears about his wife's fantasy about the naval officer, a curiosity and sense of revenge awakens in him, but he doesn't really know whether he wants to indulge the latter so he dives headlong into the former. The fact that that encounter plays over and over in his mind (and actually gets screen time even though it never happened) just goes toward emphasizing the disconnect he has from the sexual act throughout the two days that the story unfolds over. As he ventures into the night of New York City, he witnesses pretty much all manifestations of sex (exploitative, transactional, foolish and passionate, awkward, etc.), but what thoughts go through his head? I don't think he went to Domino's apartment because he intended to fuck her, but I also don't think he left purely because a reminder of his wife brought him to his senses either.

And what about his wife? Since we only get his perspective in this film, it looks to him like she's living a life dominated by lust in a way that scares and intrigues him. His assumptions about female sexual drive as evidenced in the argument after the Christmas party show that he was really not ready to hear about his wife's naval officer episode. But we never see whether she regrets telling him, or even whether it dwells in her mind anymore. But it continues to dwell in his mind, that's for sure. And then when she tells him about the nightmare it becomes clear that she does have conventional feelings about sex (especially those of shame and fear), but this is no real comfort for him now that his curiosity brought him to know about people and systems that have no regard for those conventional feelings. Does she find comfort in telling him about the dream, to get it off her chest? This is why I think he cries when he sees the mask on the bed at the end. It's not just fear for her safety, but also seeing how that world that he discovered (and wished he hadn't) is intruding into his bedroom while he isn't there. It terrifies him.

Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman do such a good job playing their characters that I'm still marveling at it.

The use of diegetic and non-diegetic music was really interesting. For the first half of the film it often seemed to be one kind, but then proved to be the other. In the second half it was more obvious, but it held much more power because it was more "movie-ish" and somehow became more unsettling or powerful as a result.

The camera movements are also wonderfully expressive. Any time I could sense the tension increasing, I noticed the editing get a little faster or the camera become untethered from a rigid stand. Not quite handheld, but something a little woozier than that. And Kubrick's willingness to hold a shot on somebody's face for such a long time, really lets you get immersed in the performance and feeling, and it almost feels like you can hear their thoughts even if they aren't speaking.

Needless to say, the scenes in the house were chilling and otherworldly.

I sensed a lot of symmetry in this film. The travel seemed to loop back on itself, like this:
- Victor's house
- Domino's apartment
- Nick's bar
- Ritual house
- Nick's hotel
- Domino's apartment
- Victor's house

And could there be a more perfect final line of dialogue? It would have seemed so mundane if it were at the beginning, maybe even funny, but placed at the end it's like, "Do I even have the same conception of fucking that I might have had 2.5 hours ago?" Similar to the "Fuck it dude, let's go bowling" line in _The Big Lebowski_, which is funny but also a wonderful end-cap to the mayhem that preceded it. Yes I just compared _The Big Lebowski_ and _Eyes Wide Shut_, get at me.

9/10
