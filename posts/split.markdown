One of the most challenging movies to rate I've watched in a long time. Was I entertained? Yes. But I also thought the movie was stupid, had too many slow scenes, and felt like it had very low stakes. The idea that people who have been abused are the "pure" ones is such Hot Topic bullcrap that I couldn't help but laugh when The Beast said that.

Can a movie be simultaneously surprising and totally predictable? For example the minute I saw a gray haired woman walking up some stairs, I was like "that's the villain's psychiatrist" and I was 200% right.

I can understand why someone would wath this movie and have his or her mind blown, but I feel like after having seen as many movies as I have, I can't help but see the flaws.
The acting was really dodgy. The blonde girl is the worst, she acts like she's in a high school play. Anya Taylor Joy is better, but she's only allowed to stand there, mouth-agape, and cry for a lot of scenes so it's hard to see how good she really is. And James McAvoy... like yeah he did a good job, but was it an amazing acting job? It's all kinda flashy accents and mood, but it didn't feel to me like "the best acting I've ever seen" which I've heard some people call it. He did seem to transform physically between the three main personas, it's cool that his face can change so much and how the face changes play such a big role in believing the person he's pretending to be.

I seriously doubt the pacing of this film could stand up to a second watch. I'd be bored senseless.

The callback to Unbreakable is so lame. I actually got spoiled on it somewhat, by knowing that a movie called Glass existed a few years later. Don't ask me how. But yeah I knew the whole time that he would have some kind of physical abilities and not just crazy mental stuff, because I knew that Mr. Glass would recruit him to be in the league of suprt pets or whatever.

There's something disrespectful about how this movie handles the split personalities, especially the trigger of saying Kevin's full name. It's like a magic spell, the people I was watching with were even saying "why doesn't she try to say his name again?" as if it's supposed to work every time, even after The Beast emerges.

The opening scene in the mall is really annoying, the camera keeps hiding half of Anya's face for no good storytelling reason. But the scene in the car before the credits roll at the beginning is really good, because the villain doesn't really react with anger or urgency, and he looks very normal with those glasses.

5/10
