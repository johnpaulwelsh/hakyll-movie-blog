_Mean Girls_ but more sweet. _Fast Times_ but less scandalous. _Grease_ but no singing and less horny. _Election_ but funnier and less icky. These are all bad comparisons. I feel like this somehow isn't the perfect teen movie, and yet it's better than all those other ones in some ineffable way.

The cast is stacked, man. Everyone seems either very familiar, or else is spot-on great at their role. The music is also pretty amazing but that's Viacom money for ya.

It's a deft slight of hand to make you root for a partial-incest relationship by making the couple as cute as can be.

Alicia Silverstone is of course beautiful and funny and over-the-top, but also she's great at the "serious" scenes. When she calls out Tai for going too far with an insult in her rock-bottom scene at the house near the fireplace, I really thought she was gonna cry a little and that it wasn't an actress anymore but a real person.

9/10
