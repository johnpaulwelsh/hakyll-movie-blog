One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Maybe a little bit too long because near the end it becomes a littlee exhausting to laugh so much. But the same thing applies to _The Blues Brothers_ and I can't imagine docking points from that movie, so I shant for this one.

I don't even really know what to say. I did laugh extra hard at the pun on "Witherspoon" because it happened so late in the film and I don't think a single pun occurred before that, so it was maybe the most fresh pun ever put into a film.

Cary Grant is a miraculous actor. Physical comedy, facial expressions, line delivery, wordless noises, he can do it all.

It's incredible how many little details are thrown in to flesh out the characters which don't seem to actually matter until much later. The fact that Mortimer is a play critic doesn't make a difference at all until the last fourth of the film when the cop and Witherspoon turn it into the biggest inconvenience that Mortimer has yet faced.

The dark scene is absolutely incredible. So inventive, and amazing from a technical perspective.

10/10
