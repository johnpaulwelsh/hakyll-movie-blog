Very clever and very charming. I don't have much of a frame of reference, but I feel like this movie's craft and production is so much more fantastical and creative than an American film from the mid 1940s would be. The flip between color and black-and-white is a great idea, and letting the afterlife be "stuck in the past" while the living world is in modern Technicolor is an awesome thematic decision.

The movie kind of halts and becomes something else when the trial begins, in a way that feels a little awkward. Before it becomes clear why the counsels are dragging the other man's country through the mud during the trial, it definitely feels like an idea tacked on from another movie. I can see why folks would see this as blatant American propaganda, but honestly it's more like anti-English propaganda. And anyway, there's a happy ending which transcends countries, so I think it's an interesting idea but not something that dwells in the mind too heavily.

The performances are great, the characters are loveable, the set pieces are really striking (the escalator, the ping-pong match, the trial). I just really enjoyed this movie.

9/10
