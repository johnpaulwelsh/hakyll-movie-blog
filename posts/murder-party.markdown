I went into this movie with pretty much the lowest amount of context possible. I knew it was a horror comedy that came out in the last 15 years, and I knew my friend Rob wanted me to watch it. I am so happy that my expectations were so vague, because _Murder Party_ is one hell of a ride.

The whole tone and feel of the movie is like someone injected a student's film school project with steroids. Right from the first couple seconds where the title card bangs right into place, I could sense the excitement that went into creating the movie. Most of the elements that I thought were appealing to recent-history nostalgia (Mac OSX with an Aqua UI, flip phones, the PSP handheld system) were actually completely accurate for the time, given that it was released in 2007 (I was shocked - my guess would have been 2014 at the earliest).

The comedy style was all over the place, which was great because it meant I was always on the edge of my seat and ready to laugh. The apparent plot of the film gets derailed so quickly that there's really no time to try and guess at what will happen next. It really feels like you're just along for the ride, just like the hapless protagonist. At times the dialogue was so ridiculous that it felt improvisational; I wouldn't be surprised if the entire "truth or dare" scene was unscripted. I also never thought I'd hear the word "dildo" so many times in less than 90 minutes.

I'm also glad that the film wove in some elements of satire towards the whole indie art scene. It rode the fine line between throwaway subplot and heavy-handed main message, which felt just right. It also acted as a good reminder that while all these characters are absolutely loathsome, they inhabit a world that's only an exaggeration of reality, not a total fabrication. The writers could have made the whole premise be "What would happen if edgy millennial artists ran out of ideas and decided to kill someone as their next project," but I'm glad they stepped back one level from that and left it as a nice little frosting to the cake instead.

Murder Party is one of the most surprising and enjoyable horror comedies I've ever seen. I cannot believe this movie exists but I'm so glad it does.

8/10
