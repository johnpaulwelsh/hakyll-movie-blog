        <p>This is just a really good episode of the show. It has really funny and zany moments, but doesn’t go overboard with them like some of the dream-sequence episodes did (the <em>Christmas Carol</em> one and the dream-doctor one in particular). It also had some “just good” stuff, like the showdown at the prison and the abandoned mental asylum part, and the movie references were on point (<em>The Spanish Prisoner</em>? I’ve written about that one!).</p>
<p>The appearance of Lassiter would have been a disappointingly short one, had I not already been aware that the second <em>Psych</em> movie was called <em>Lassie Come Home</em> so I know I get to see him more in the next one.</p>
