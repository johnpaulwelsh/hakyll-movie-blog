"This could even be a comedy" yeah right Bergman, you bastard.

I can't believe how much this movie captivated me. It seemed to just keep changing and unfolding in ways I didn't expect, but that never felt jarring or incongruous. I think this film has a lot to say but I'm not quite sure what it all is. Maybe it's about control, and waiting in the wings is the revelation that Jenny is a domineering monster who drags everyone under with her. Or maybe it has to do with being grateful for what you have, since Nelly obviously . Or maybe when it comes to Ingeborg, the movie is trying to show that she needs to let go of possession of Nelly, but even though Nelly comes back to her, she's a changed person. It's all so complicated.

I can definitely say that I would not have appreciated this movie at all if I had watched it during college, or any time earlier than that. I suspect if I watch it again in 10 or 20 years, I'll feel even more different feelings than I did this time. It seems to be a film about adults, even if one of the main characters is a youth.

It's impressive that a movie directed by a man in the 40s is so focused on women and the relationships between them.

I don't really understand what happened to Jenny, or what the bubbling water near the train meant. I assumed Jenny drowned herself, but the film doesn't make it clear.

8/10
