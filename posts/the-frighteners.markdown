The best word for this movie is "bonkers." Maybe also "rip roarin' good time" would work as well.

Peter Jackson is a madman with the camera, and he gets really excellent over-the-top performance out of everybody, but especially the FBI man and adult Patricia.

I like that the movie doesn't linger too long on the whole "frighteners" con-man operation that Frank runs. It takes just long enough to show what's going on but then moves on to the rest of the plot.

The CGI is bad, but it's also really expressive and interesting so it gets a pass.

There are some parts that are a little dumb, but they're dumb in a cute way. Like how Frank gets to go back to earth at the end, for obvious but dubious reasons. And I think there are kind of a lot of scenes that linger on the FBI guy for extended periods of time; I suspect these become way less enjoyable on rewatches, and I even thought they went on a bit too long compared to the snappy pace of all the other events in the movie.

8/10
