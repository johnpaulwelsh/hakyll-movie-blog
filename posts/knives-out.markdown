A fun mystery movie, exactly what I was hoping it would be. I liked that the pacing and characterizations are pretty much exactly how it would be in a book, it makes the story feel more fresh than if it were just a longer _Murder She Wrote_ episode.

Overall I think it was an interesting idea to have one big reveal happen early on, but to also keep a twist at the end. The "donut hole in the donut's hole" metaphor is apt, while also being hilarious. But it also makes the story feel low-stakes overall. I knew Ransom had something to do with it as soon as the diner scene was wrapping up, so the final reveal is really just a matter of how involved he actually is. The final "here's how it happened" scene is good, but it felt like there weren't enough surprises brought to light because we already knew the manner of death was the throat-slit.

I also think the cast should have been smaller, or more of the family members should have been involved in the core mystery. It seems like most of the family is only there to throw them into suspicion briefly (before Marta's flashback reveals what actually happened), or as a way of setting up the mystery.

I did really like that the story centered on such a nice character as Martha. It's a little cartoony that she barfs any time she lies, but it makes her a little more endearing.

And Daniel Craig's accent is epically bad.

7/10
