        <p>This movie rules. It wastes no time before the camera starts going bonkers and the set design just pops off the screen in a marvelous way. This movie has a really excellent blend of great little side-scenes or single shots mixed in to the important story scenes, to the point that it feels like everything is instantly memorable.</p>
<p>The acting is superb, especially Marc’s and Giana’s. Marc has such an expressive face, every scene that has even a slightly comedic tone becomes hilarious with him involved. Special shout-out to the arm-wrestling scene.</p>
<p>The music is awesome, even when it fades out abruptly or feels totally inappropriate for the scene. I actually like that the music lowers the scare factor by making scenes feel more like music videos.</p>
<p>I feel bad for anyone who would get distracted by the terrible lip sync on most characters, they’re missing out on a wonderful thriller movie. If <em>Suspiria</em> ends up improving itself in my mind when I get around to a rewatch, then Dario Argento will become one of my favorite new discoveries.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
