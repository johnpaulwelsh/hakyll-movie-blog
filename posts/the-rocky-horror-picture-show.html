        <p>Hard to believe this really exists. Even from the beginning it’s strange, like it doesn’t only get weird or silly or self-aware when they get to the castle. I mean, it begins with a glitzy glam-rock cover of the 20th Century Fox theme.</p>
<p>There are ups and downs of course. The series of songs in the lab gets a little overwhelming and chaotic, especially the transition into “Hot Patootie.”</p>
<p>But the songs are undeniable, like have you heard “Sweet Transvestite?” Or “I’m Going Home?” When it gets to Frank singing “Whatever happened to Fay Wray?” I am pretty much sold on this being a major milestone in Western entertainment.</p>
<p>Tim Curry is a maniac and I can’t look away from his face.</p>
