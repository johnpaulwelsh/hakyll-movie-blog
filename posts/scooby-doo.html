        <p>Revisiting this was a good birthday present. The CGI is god-awful, I cannot believe that the budget on this was $85 million. The story is almost too complicated, it canâ€™t decide if voodoo, ancient rituals, or spirit harvesting is the main thing so they throw it all in at once. The cast is great. The jokes are lame but I still laughed, especially the farting, much to my shame.</p>
