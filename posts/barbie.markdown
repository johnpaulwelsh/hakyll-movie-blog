What a weird and unexpected movie. It's shocking that Mattel and WB cleared a movie that's so up-front about its cultural commentary and feminism. It reminds me a lot of _The Lego Movie_, not only in that Will Ferrell plays a goofy corporate adult character in both movies, but also because both movies grapple with the cultural cache that their properties have in a way that's honest without undercutting the enjoyment factor of the movie. But the movie never really gives up its summer blockbuster feeling, which is also like _The Lego Movie_.

Ryan Gosling deserves a Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He gives 110% in every scene and it shows. There were a lot of other jump-scare surprises in the cast too, like Michael Cera. The song-and-dance fight sequence was honestly amazing to watch.

I think some of the movie has tone issues, and the big pivotal speech by America Ferrara's character is on-the-nose to sightly too much of a degree. It reminded me of the one on-the-nose speech given in _Little Women_, so maybe Greta Gerwig has a pattern emerging. And since it's still leaning into the summer blockbuster feeling, there are some elements of the second act which feel low-stakes, the way that a lot of _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_ felt.

There are a surprising number of adult jokes, which I kinda knew about coming in since it's rated PG-13, but once I finally heard and saw them I realized that they could have toned down the plot a little bit and easily made fit a PG mold. I wonder whether Gerwig and Baumbach realized that they wanted to tell a mature story which requires maturity to appreciate, so they added just too many genital jokes to hit the higher rating and avoid parents bringing their elementary-school kids to see it. I did find most of the humor really funny, although some of it was so blunt that it left the audience laughing nervously instead of a normal laugh (this is an example of the tonal issues I noted earlier).

The emotionally honest and raw moments are by far the best-executed. Any time Barbie or Ken (the main ones) cry, I wanted to cry too. 

As for themes. Obviously the main theme here is that being a woman is hard, and we should celebrate any and all outlets to give women a break for having to deal with such high expectations. But the secondary themes are the most interesting ones for me. I see the whole Ken plot as "any time men or women vie for power, they all lose." And I think the mother-daughter relationship plot is pretty straight-foward, but also indicative of the kind of indie-darling cred that we've seen for the last few dacades, namely a focus on the struggles of parenthood instead of teenagerhood (heck, it's a small plot twist that the girl who's wrecking Barbie is not the girl, but the girl's mom). Just look at _EEAAO_ and _Hereditary_ as some recent stories told by young people, but mostly about parents instead of about their kids.

It was kind of refreshing to have a movie talk to bluntly about the words patriarchy and feminism without making each and every name-drop into an opportunity to score points or something. Maybe it just means something about my maturity level, but usually when I hear a movie or TV show mention the patriarchy it's in passing as a cheer-line for the woke crowd and a cringe-line for the normal people. But I didn't feel that way while watching _Barbie_.

It's worth stating clearly that this movie is very funny and entertaining. I found myself giggling with glee many times, and not due to some kind of pop culture reference, instead it was old-fashioned good moviemaking. Will Ferrell and his goons doing physical comedy, or Ryan Gosling emoting like a champ, or the dance moves of the army of Kens.

8/10
