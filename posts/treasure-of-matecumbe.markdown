Considering that it's a corny Disney live-action film, it's actually pretty fun. The adult characters are uniformly hilarious and entertaining, and the kids being bad actors is fun too. Honestly, most of the skeevy sensitive plot elements are handled rather appropriately, except for the Native Americans... yeesh. I could listen to Peter Ustinov say and do basically anything.

7/10
