The Netflix description for this movie is unacceptable. It completely spoils the face that the main character is an alien, and even mentions the mysterious black pool of liquid! Before the movie started I glanced at the first three words ("A seductive alien") and as much as I tried to fight it, knowing that she was an alien completely altered the way I watched the film. I have sent a complaint to Netflix and asked them to change the description to something less spoiler-tastic.

Even with that handicap, I thought the movie was great.

One of the first themes I grasped in the film is the idea of beauty versus ugliness. Pretty much everyone in the movie is ugly (some exaggeratedly so) except for the main character, and she's knockout gorgeous. All the men are scraggly douchebags or medium-sized tough guys, and of the very few women we get a good look at, most of them are in that desperate and trashy gaggle of clubbers, none of which are beautiful in a fair sense of the word. The point is really driven home when we meet the disfigured man, which I'll come back to later.

I think this contrast of beauty and ugliness sets up the next element of the film that I latched onto, which is the way the plot addresses different perspectives on femme-fatale-style seduction. For starters, let's admit that the stuff the woman does to the men in the first half of the movie would be utterly horrifying if a man was doing it to women instead. But at first we think that these men "have it coming." They're gross and horny, so why not get sucked into a vat of spooky space liquid and have your innards ripped out from your skin?

But once she is confronted with a man with an honest need for intimacy (in the form of the Elephant-Man-looking dude), we immediately realize how monstrous she is and we hope that she spares him, which she eventually does. This sets off a chain of events that leads the woman to reconsider what she's been doing and what effect it has on these humans she has been terrorizing.

Later, when she meets a genuinely nice guy and what looks like romance begins to bloom, there's a truly excellent scene that shows just how naive the woman is about human sexuality. When she and the man have sex, she freaks out halfway through and shines a desk lamp into her vagina as if she didn't even know it was there. I think this is the first time she understands what human intercourse actually is, and it's almost like a pubescent awakening mixed with pity and horror. All this time she had been seducing men in order to trap them and feed off them, but she clearly didn't understand what seduction actually means. She had the power to lead these foolish men into her lair, but it isn't until this raw moment of intimacy that she realizes what her role in the transaction actually is.

Right after this, the tables get turned on her and the man in the woods now victimizes her with sexual assault. Now that she fully appreciates the power of the human sexual drive, it is used against her as a weapon. It's chilling stuff.

I think the way the story uses the woman's male motorcycle-riding counterpart is a tour de force in the art of implication. We first see him as some kind of accomplice, but his role is shrouded in mystery because the focus rarely falls on him. When he inspects her eye, that was the first time I suspected that he was a fellow alien and that he was trying to make sure she's doing her job without error. Finally when he hunts down the Elephant Man and finishes the job that the woman couldn't finish, it becomes clear what his role really is. And all without a word of dialogue. It's extremely subtle storytelling and I think it works great.

I also want to point out the poetic excellence of the final scene. It goes right back to the title of the movie: what is "under the skin"? I think it's the the decency, compassion, and fear that we all take for granted, but that the alien woman needs to learn herself - basically, our humanity. She has it all backwards - on the surface she is a human, but under the skin she's not. As the story progresses, she becomes more alienated with her human body because she comes to learn more about it, while her personality becomes more human-like. So when her skin is ripped off at the end it perfectly visualizes the transformation that's been happening across the rest of the film. At the time of the woman's death, she is exposed as an alien but also has more humanity than she ever has before.

The score was amazing. It all sounded like an unsettling cacophony that didn't seem organic or artificial. How fitting for a film about human-skinned aliens.

Unfortunately, some scenes went on so long that it became easy to space out, and my mind would usually wander toward other shows or movies that reminded me of this film (such as Twin Peaks The Return). However, maybe I was more susceptible to my mind wandering because the spoilery Netflix description kept nagging at me for the whole movie, in the back of my mind.

One last note. If you wanna just see Scarlett Johannson naked, you came to the *WRONGGGGGG* movie. Almost all of her nude/seductive scenes are either story-relevant or paired with some other horrifying image. This includes stealing another girl's clothes while she is awake but paralyzed, leading a naked and erect man to his certain demise, or inspecting herself for the "power vein" of red liquid that subtly runs across her body. I feel bad for anyone who picked this movie because they wanted to see some nudes.

8/10
