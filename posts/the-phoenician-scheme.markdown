title: The Phoenician Scheme

I just got out of the Phoenician scheme and I liked it, but I really am starting to
wonder what exactly do I like about Wes Anderson so I think that sometimes I
watch his movies and I am pleased by the experience and I know he's trying to
get at something but I'm too stupid to know what it is that's usually I think
that's how I felt about Astrid City but I think that this one is different
where I think I just missed what he was going for like plot-wise it's one of
those things where I don't really know what was trying to be built and I don't
know why I've been in the Cumberbatch blew himself up what kind of
revelation inspired it but I think like it's positive far out way it's
negative I think that there's some points where because it's not as hyperactive
as I'm used to some parts felt surprisingly spare like anytime in the
beginning when Joshua's talking to his daughter in the house there's like an awful
lot of not cutting back and forth and like full conversations that don't get
interrupted it's kind of unusual it sometimes feels boring but like I
honestly think it's less exhausting so maybe I'm more thankful for it and I
mean it's very funny but I think it's funny because he is the king of
framing slapstick humor it's just so amazing how impactful the the frame of
the camera can make a punch or a kick or someone flying across the screen or just
the sound effects of it to combining with the visuals I I wonder how this
compares with the Royal Ten of Bombs because I think that one's also about the
distant rich jerk dad but this one is obviously more limited in scope because
he only really builds a relationship again with one kid instead of trying to
with all of them if I remember correctly
Alexander Desclat also just is so good at the music he composes it's just like
so antiquated and propulsive and interesting it can make any scene more
interesting I want to be surprised if Anderson like paces the scenes to temp
tracks or something because of how well the music fills it out also I'm getting
to the point where it's funny to see Wes Anderson kind of in a point where he
can do no wrong and he's constantly given money to do his thing but it's not
clear to me who is interested in his thing other than like Nick because like I
don't I'm not a devotee you know I've seen almost everything he's done but I
have basically no memories of moon rice kingdom or ten of bombs or bottle
rocket or rush more and I didn't care that much about the French dispatch so I
guess I'll keep going to see them because it's just so unlike anything that
anyone has made before and I think 10 or 20 years from now people will look back
and realize that Wes Anderson never had a misstep because he just locked in his
type of movie so closely I really would love to be a fly on the wall of Roman
Coppola and him coming up with the stories for these movies because I don't
know what they are I can barely I can barely summarize this movie to somebody I
certainly couldn't summarize Astrid City to somebody because I think it was so
high-faluten and high concept but I also you know another positive for this one
is I just like seeing Catholic iconography and characters I just like seeing
nuns and priests and crosses and dream sequences that are religious in nature
so like if I ever go back to watching this one again in the next like 10
years I think it'll be because I just like the character and presence of
we soul so much but I mean the Nietzsche de Torres great too like he like I
wouldn't be surprised if he's the secondary star in Wes's next movie just
because they work so well because he was in French dispatch too that's basically
the first main character you meet in the storylines so I guess that's it I liked
did

8/10
