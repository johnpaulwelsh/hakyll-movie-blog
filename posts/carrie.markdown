_Carrie_ is a very stupid story, but told really well.

There really isn't all that much meat to the story of _Carrie_, and it's not in any way subtle about what's happening. High school girls are horrible and petty, high school boys are pigs, Carrie's mother is a religious nutcase, and Carrie is victimized by all of them. There's one member of each group (girls, boys, maternal figures) that is purer of heart than the rest, but even they fail to actually help Carrie in the end.

The visuals, music and sound, and performances are really what elevates this movie from "crappy b-movie slasher" to "iconic horror tragedy." De Palma really seems to milk some scenes as much as he can by using slo-mo and dream-like camera filters, but I think it works wonderfully. The music is also over-the-top dramatic, but not in a way that feels sappy or manipulative. It's almost like an opera, where the music is bombastic because it has to fill a giant auditorium and because the emotions reach such a critical mass, not because the story is actually that grandiose. And finally, Sissy Spacek is kind of perfect in this role. She really comes across as a shy high-schooler undergoing major emotional stress, and her moments of happiness during the prom are just sublime.

In the end, I don't really think _Carrie_ means anything special. I guess you could say the recurring use of blood makes the movie have some sort of theme related to maturity and female sexuality, but I'm sure Stephen King wasn't thinking much deeper than that when he wrote the core story that was adapted into this film. It's just a story where everybody is punished for their sins, and Carrie is punished along with them just to make you feel bad for her and to be shocked. I just think De Palma did a really good job of making a real _movie_ out of the story of _Carrie_, by working in a lot of things that can only happen in film, and therefore forcing the story to take a back seat where it belongs.

I was always kind of annoyed that the culture around me basically _forced_ me to be spoiled on what happens at the prom in this movie. I mean, even the movie poster kind of spoils what happens by showing her covered in blood. I am glad I was finally able to see it, so my knowledge of what happens is no longer secondhand guessing.

Strange anecdote: I saw this movie in a theater as a Fathom event on a Sunday afternoon. The only people in the theater other than me, I came to learn, were a dad, mom, teenage girl, and preteen boy. In the bathroom afterwards, the boy was telling the dad that he noticed that one of the bit actors in the movie had the surname "De Palma" and he thought that meant the kid was Brian De Palma's nephew or something. And then dad replied, "I think that kid is also in _Jaws_, as the mayor's kid." So a nine-year-old boy just watched a rated-R movie with a ton of violence and nudity, and he seemed to read the credits closely enough (and have enough of a knack for cinema trivia) that he was talking about the De Palma family connection. And then his dad replied to him with more trivia! It's like he was talking to one of his adult buddies after seeing a movie together, not at ALL what I'd expect from the father of a young son.
