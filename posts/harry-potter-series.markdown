**1) _Sorcerer's Stone_ (01.30.20)**

The camera is refreshingly old-fashioned, not zipping around all over the place like modern fantasy movies.

The quidditch scenes are almost all CGI and it's kinda distracting.

Hermione is so annoying but also adorable. Ron is the cutest main character. Alan Rickman pours his heart and soul into the role and every like of dialogue is like he's swallowing a disgusting medicine.

There's a lot of "ok let's go with it" in the beginning parts, like between the snake at the zoo and Hagrid busting into the remote shack to take Harry. It also has a very 90s kids-movie feel where there's massive chaos but it's all grounded in Harry enjoying it, so it's not scary.

The mystery really holds the story together in this one.

8/10

**2) _Chamber of Secrets_ (02.02.20)**

Arthur Weasley is amazing.

The Burrow scene is perfectly paced, doesn't linger too long.

Hermione becomes a little version of her adult self, instead of looking like a kiddo.

Lucius is brutal right away.

Special effects scenes are better.

The plot of this one is ultra strong, a big improvement over Sorcerer's Stone.

Thank God they mix puppetry and CGI, Fawkes and the Basilisk wouldn't have been as cool as all one or the other.

10/10

**3) _Prisoner of Azkaban_ (02.03.20)**

Beginning is more dynamic than in the previous movies, but kind of annoying. Goofy shit, loud music, crazy camera movement. It's like Cuaron tried to do a Tim Burton movie.

Hermione is perfection. Ron and Hermione fighting is adorable.

The color and atmosphere is perfect, especially the Dementors.

The craziest establishing shots ever.

Lupin is a great role.

Camerawork is amazong when they go back in time, perfect framing and music too.

There are an awful lot of "random" happenings before they go back in time and actually explain why it happened (the rocks getting thrown through the window, the fake wolf call).

7/10

**4) _Goblet of Fire_ (02.04.20)**

Every movie starts with some kind of magical transportation system, and it's more absurd every time. Train, flying car,

There's more room to breathe in the mis-en-scene, compared to _Azkaban_.

The Great Hall scene where the other schools and Moody show up is really disjointed and awkward.

Hermione is such a know-it-all bitch sometimes, especially the "aging potion" scene with Fred and George. People tend to forget that part of her because she's so beautiful.

The dragon trial is very exciting and the CGI is great.

Does Fleur talk even once in this movie? Yes, and it's basically two lines of English and a few Frenchisms thrown in around it.

The drama of finding a date to the ball is hilarious.

Cho emerges as a completely random romantic interest, considering that at least Hermione has a lot of established back and forth with Viktor.

I've never seen a more accurate depiction of sitting on the sidelines of a school dance and sulking while watching everyone else have fun, than the Yule Ball scene near the end.

The Mad Eye Moody / Barty Crouch Jr. reveal is soooooooo implausible. How does Crouch know so much about how to fake being a teacher for an entire two semesters? You're telling me Moody was never himself at all this year?

8/10

**5) _Order of the Phoenix_ (02.05.20)**

The pacing is really good in this one.

Luna is fucking adorable but she isn't given enough screen time in this one.

Snape is back to his peak performance. "Obviously" is a perfect scene.

The Occlumency scene is placed pretty awkwardly after the scene where Harry has a hissy fit in Dumbledore's office.

The Ministry of Magic and Umbridge's behavior is the best argument possible for getting the federal government's nose out of private schools. Theoretical defense against the dark arts? Tattle club? Paranoia about hostile takeovers of the government? Standardized tests? You'd think J.K. Rowling was Ayn Rand.

The showdown in the Department of Mysteries is kind of anticlimactic. Maybe because Voldemort doesn't show up himself until the end. Maybe because they spend so long in the movie not explaining that he wants a prophecy, or what the prophecy is about.

The veil is kinda spooky in the movie but it felt much more important in the book.

Why is there no music in the final fight scenes?????? It makes the death of Sirius and the Dumbledore/Voldemort showdowns so bland. When Harry fights back in his mind againdt Voldemort it's pretty good though.

Tonks is criminally underutilized.

7/10

**6) _Half-Blood Prince_ (02.06.20)**

Snape is as good as always.

I really appreciate that Dumbledore is letting Harry in on his plans more than ever in this one, it's fitting because he kept him at arm's length in the previous year so it makes sense he would try to correct the other way, especially because of his impending doom.

The balance of serious stuff and goofy relationship stuff is enjoyable. This is the funniest HP movie for sure.

The footage of them making a potion in potion's class is kinda shocking. Is this the longest scene of actual schoolwork in any of the movies?

The reveal about the identity of the Half-Blood Prince is really underwhelming, mostly because it doesn't make a difference. If it gave better insight into why Snape would betray Dumbledore (or why he actually is very noble and was tricking Voldemort instead), then it would be something to mull over between movies. But it's basically like "I'm the HBP" and then he runs away.

8/10
