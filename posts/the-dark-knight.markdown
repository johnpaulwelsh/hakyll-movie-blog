One of the most thrilling movies of all time, and for that alone it deserves a 10/10. It's pretty much firing on all cylinders from when the Chinese guy gets arrested all the way till the end. There are so many iconic scenes that I honestly forgot everything about the first 30 minutes except for the scenes with the Joker.

After watching _Batman Begins_ it's kind of relieving how little of this movie revolves around Bruce Wayne and his feelings. This feels like an actual Batman movie, in comparison to the prequel which is a psychological profile of the man who becomes Batman.

On the other hand, the Joker doesn't even feel like a comic book villain, which is an amazing feat. If you compare him to Nicholson's Joker, it's like they decided to take the same basic premise and turn him into a legit scary domestic terrorist instead of a cartoon. Somehow the scenes with Joker are more gritty and realistic than anything in _Batman Begins_.

The plot of this movie is pretty complex actually, I almost didn't follow some parts.

The ferry situation finally hit home with me this time, on my third watch. The Joker knows that Batman won't kill anybody, and he thinks that Gotham is more willing to go that far, but they don't. The people of Gotham are aligned with Batman on that front, and Joker is disappointed because he thought that they would be more ruthless when placed in life-or-death situations. It also makes the final confrontation with Dent make more sense. He's abandoned that rule and Gotham would truly tear itself apart if they found out he had killed people out of some sense of revenge. It's almost like a post-9/11 conundrum: does the WTC disaster drive us to abandon our core values in order to achieve order and safety?

Gotham should not have survived this film. It's kind of annoying that there even is a third movie. Like, if you had Scarecrow and then Joker in the span of a couple years, how could you possibly put up with Bane trapping every cop in the super bowl and shutting down the whole city? That's when I start feeling like the feds or National Guard really ought to be involved.

Gotham doesn't even look the same as it did in the first movie. Where are the futuristic El trains? Or Arkham Island?

Dent deserved a better finale than becoming another well-known Batman villain. Knowing that Two-Face is an established character makes his story feel a little cheap and cameo-ish.

Now that I know what IMAX resolution looks like, it's really obvious whenever it changes throughout the movie between IMAX and normal. I love the tall scenes in IMAX though.

10/10
