I used to think I definitely love this movie more than _Vol. 1_. But upon rewatching, I think they're kind of equal, even though they're so different. The first movie is cool in all the typical ways, swordfighting and badassery and the anime break. But this one is cool in more mundane ways, like the music, and the way the camera frames certain scenes, or Bill playing his little flute thing.

Even though the first movie is very light on plot, I think _Vol. 2_'s main weakness is that we have to get through killing Budd and taking care of Elle before making it to Bill. It's not that the first half of the movie is boring, I mean the burial scene and Pai Mei are truly fantastic. But it feels like they are plot requirements rather than something I'm excited to see in the moment.

It's interesting that there's no real explanation about why the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad seemed to break up after The Bride left. Obviously it happened, but they never explain why.

I've always loved how once The Bride meets BB, almost all of the scenes between her and Bill are her being really distraught and emotional, and him being cool as a cucumber.

10/10
