A _Twilight Zone_ episode done right, and done 30 years earlier which is impressive. I wonder if this is more of a 7/10, but that it feels better because it's short and tightly plotted.

I don't have much to say about the merits of the film, it's just a good tragedy with a clever emphasis on armedness vs. armlessness. The story works because Alonzo is a bad guy, if he was merely a nice friendzoned man then his turn to vengeance wouldn't feel right.

Some of the footage (especially of Nanon and her beau outdoors) looked like they laid terrycloth over the lens, it's a really weird artifact.

It's cool to see Alonzo realize that he wants to cut off his arms but there's no title card stating what he said. It's pretty obvious to the audience what he means though. It shows a trust in the intelligence of the audience.

8/10
