I pretty much entirely agree with [this video](It Wasn't That Bad - Drop Dead Fred), except I think it's less funny.

There are three great parts:

* The beginning where little Elizabeth says "what a pile of shit"
* Carrie Fisher thinking she's beating Fred up in the hallway
* The climax where grown-up Elizabeth rescues little girl Elizabeth in the dream sequence

Everything else is just okay, or features too much cringe humor and needless destruction for me.

Also I can't get over how Charles is the vice president from _The West Wing_.

4/10
