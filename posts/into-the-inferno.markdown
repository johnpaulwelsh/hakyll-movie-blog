I can't believe how *fast* lava flows. The volcano footage is uniformly astounding of course, worth the price of admission just for the last five minutes worth of footage.

At first the structure of the movie felt scatter brained, but eventually it becomes clear that Herzog wants to show as wide a range as possible of the kinds of human cultures that sprout up around volcanos. A parallel is bridged between ancient Ethiopian ancestors, modern cargo cults, and the strangeness of North Korea. Some of his narration is a little on-the-nose and poetic, but it's probably just the right amount without feeling too pretentious.

This also happens to be the first movie I've ever split watching over more than one day (not counting taking a nap or long sleep and finishing later that night, which I did with _The Irishman_). I think it would have bothered me much more if it were a fictional narrative film, rather than a documentary.

7/10
