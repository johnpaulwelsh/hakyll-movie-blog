It's an okay movie. It's not really a great sports movie because the final battle doesn't show the team using a different, riskier strategy than they've used in the past. Their foe is sufficiently scary (New Zealand has an man-ogre on their team), and Mandela does give the captain a copy of that poem that he loved so much, but it's not as if the captain read the poem to the team as one final pump-up - they kind of just go for it. Also, there was far too much slow-motion footage during the overtime period of that last game. It felt like five straight minutes of slomo!

Other than that, there's nothing big to complain about. The Mandela scenes were a good mix of serious and funny, and it convinced me that the unification of South Africa behind one rugby team was a noble and realistic goal, even though I don't care much about national-level sports. I guess the plot wasn't too risky once Mandela says he wants the Springboks to win the World Cup, because of course they're going to - that's how these movies work. But it was pleasant to watch anyway.

Side note, Amazon Prime Instant Video doesn't seem to have an option for subtitles, so there's a handful of scenes of dialogue I missed in the first half hour. Note to self: look up how to enable subs before watching another movie where the accents are unfamiliar.

Second side note, there's one point where a pop song is playing while Mandela descends in a helicopter and oh my goodness, the lyrics and singing on that song were cringe city. I started laughing out loud.
