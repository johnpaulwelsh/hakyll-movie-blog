When a movie tries to tell a story "from the eyes of a child," the laziest way to do that is to just show events from a lower camera perspective and to have a child's face in the side of the frame most of the time. Unfortunately, this movie did a lot of that. And for the first 60% of the runtime, I didn't find myself invested in the personal experience of the protagonist, Loung, probably because she rarely expressed any emotion about what she was seeing and doing. There were far too many scenes where something cruel or scary happened, and Loung just looks on with a vaguely somber, but otherwise unemotional face.

Overall the movie was pretty good. The slow, methodical progression from normal life to Communist slave-labor was pretty upsetting, especially in hindsight as I began to remember how comparatively normal things looked in the early scenes.

I think the movie could have done a better job of placing the events in their historical context. The phrase Kmher Rouge doesn't show up very often at all, just at the beginning and the end, and the other names that the Communists give themselves are not familiar to me, so I briefly got confused about whether the radicals were the same people I knew killed so many of their own people under that guy Pol Pot. I also didn't know anything about the Vietnamese involvement with Cambodia, so I wasn't sure if the Khmer propagandists were serious about their anti-Vietnamese sentiment, or if they were just hatemongering.

Also, small nitpick: it takes like 1.5 hours for them to kill the father, so it's not clear to me what series of events that was the "first" of.

6/10
