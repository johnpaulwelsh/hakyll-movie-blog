Slightly worse, but only slightly. The long segment in the middle where they're tailing the guy and ending with fighting Dummy in the burnt out apartment is pretty slow. But everything else is great, the humor is there still and the action is almost better than the first movie at times. What a great final fight scene location.

8/10
