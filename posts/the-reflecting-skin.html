        <p>This is one of the most repulsive movies I’ve ever seen. Every character is more detestable than the last, even though you’re watching them all suffer immensely you don’t really want to take anybody’s side. You feel like you should pity them, but then they do something absolutely horrible. I’m honestly shocked that somebody wrote this screenplay and a production company decided, “yeah let’s do that.”</p>
<p>The music and scenery are amazing, and there are definitely some moments that stand out, like the scene where Dolphin is telling Seth that he will grow old and decay while the camera is just fixed on the Cadillac coming down the road. And I like that the movie goes out of the way to not show anything scary happening during the night. But overall I can’t figure out how I felt about this movie because it’s so unpleasant to watch.</p>
<p>I still can’t figure out what was the deal with that wax fetus thing. I actually had my mouth hanging open during the scene where they find it in the barn. It felt like a David Lynch move, especially because of how matter-of-fact the kids’ reaction is towards it.</p>
<p>The ending scene is really cringey, with the kid screaming and grasping the dirt and posing like he’s in a music video.</p>
