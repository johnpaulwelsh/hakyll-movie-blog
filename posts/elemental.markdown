Actually quite a good movie. I'm glad that there really isn't a villain or an action-adventure motivator like an evil city planner or something, but also the conflict really isn't "my parents don't understand," though that's part of it. It's mainly a movie about being emotionally vulnerable and honest with yourself. When's the last time a likeable protagonist in a kids movie had a primary character flaw of anger? And there is a real romance happening, not a culturally-representational friendship that breaks down barriers, and not a flimsy teenage puppy love thing.

Wade is absolutely adorable and so is his family. It's so obviously Midwestern white culture that I was shocked to learn Wade's voice actor is black.

There is a little bit too much of "my background has tragedy or sad memories so here's how I act in response." Wade's dad died, Ember's whole immigrant parent thing, and even Gale's sports bonding with her dad. It's kinda lame when you hear them all in a row like that.

It's a very beautiful movie of course, the colors but also the music. I was never once annoyed by the soundtrack. The world building doesn't make any sense though, why are fire people seemingly the only ghettoed race? And how did they make anything out of metal without fire?

One of the things I don't want to overemphasize is the racial or cultural metaphor stuff, because no kids movie is ever gonna be nuanced and enjoyable at the same time on that front, and I liked the central romance too much to get bogged down in that stuff. But I am fascinated by this film's entry into what feels like a big trend in the 2010s and 2020s which is dealing with first gen immigrants and their expectations. This, _Turning Red_, _Encanto_, and _Everything Everywhere All at Once_, at least. It makes me wonder if people are tackling Latino and Asian family trauma stories because black or middle-Eastern ones are too complicated or politically fraught.

8/10
