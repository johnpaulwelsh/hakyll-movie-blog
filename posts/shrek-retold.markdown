Wild n' crazy stuff. The music was really excellent, the animations were wacky as heck, and the live action segments were my favorites by far. Also David Liebe Hart!!!

It's a really interesting project, to rely so much on the audience's familiarity with a 2001 kid's movie so they can use it as a jumping-point for one of the most accomplished internet remixes ever. I'm glad I live in this generation.

8/10
