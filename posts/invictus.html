        <p>It’s an okay movie. It’s not really a great sports movie because the final battle doesn’t show the team using a different, riskier strategy than they’ve used in the past. Their foe is sufficiently scary (New Zealand has an man-ogre on their team), and Mandela does give the captain a copy of that poem that he loved so much, but it’s not as if the captain read the poem to the team as one final pump-up - they kind of just go for it. Also, there was far too much slow-motion footage during the overtime period of that last game. It felt like five straight minutes of slomo!</p>
<p>Other than that, there’s nothing big to complain about. The Mandela scenes were a good mix of serious and funny, and it convinced me that the unification of South Africa behind one rugby team was a noble and realistic goal, even though I don’t care much about national-level sports. I guess the plot wasn’t too risky once Mandela says he wants the Springboks to win the World Cup, because of course they’re going to - that’s how these movies work. But it was pleasant to watch anyway.</p>
<p>Side note, Amazon Prime Instant Video doesn’t seem to have an option for subtitles, so there’s a handful of scenes of dialogue I missed in the first half hour. Note to self: look up how to enable subs before watching another movie where the accents are unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Second side note, there’s one point where a pop song is playing while Mandela descends in a helicopter and oh my goodness, the lyrics and singing on that song were cringe city. I started laughing out loud.</p>
