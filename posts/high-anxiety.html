        <p>I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would. It’s clearly most similar to <em>Young Frankenstein</em> in that it’s a pastiche of a specific film or style (in this case, Hitchcock) with a careful eye and some legitimate filmic technique. I especially liked how vintage everything looked. I know it’s from the 70s so that might just be how all movies looked, but the set design and costumes definitely gave off a late-50s Technicolor vibe that I found endearing.</p>
<p>The plot is a little flimsy because there’s never any good reason given for why the bad guys are doing what they do. Mel Brooks plays the straight man fairly well, given that we never see him in such a role. The minor characters are amazing too, and I want to especially single out Madeline Kahn as one of the funniest people in the film. It’s rare to see a female comedian who’s so good as physical comedy and voices, but she’s right up there with Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. The guy who played Dr. Little Oldman was adorable too.</p>
<p>The specific callouts to Hitchcock’s films were pretty cute, with <em>The Birds</em> being the laziest and <em>Psycho</em> being the most spot-on. I haven’t seen all his films but I wouldn’t be surprised if the camera-through-underside-of-glass-table shot was lifted from a Hitchcock thriller (before Brooks sillied it up with all the ridiculous chinaware blocking the shot).</p>
