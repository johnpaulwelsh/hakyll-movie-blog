This is like the opposite of _Bacurau_. Instead of "hey colonialist white pigdogs, come get us and we'll get you!" it's "what if your right-wing uncle's greatest fears came true, but also everybody took advantage of it for cynical personal gain?"

Eventually someone had to make a movie which took aim at all the crazy stuff going on during the pandemic for very-online people, and I think now is the right time for that movie to have been made. If it were too late, the touchpoints would be harder to remember, and too early, it would piss everybody off. I bet lots of people will still get pissed off by this movie, either because they took Covid lockdowns seriously (and this movie makes fun of that), or they took BLM seriously (it makes fun of that too).

more thoughts there were so many little details that maybe are like I think they
work perfectly but I would bet you that someone more online than me would think
that they're all very like cringe or obvious but like when the when the
magic harp guy is showing the phone to to the sheriff when he's on the plane
and it's sideways but it's all footage that's shot upright like that's so dead
on that you're not paying attention to like what were you shooting your phone
to show to someone else and that the that Michael is in the Bitcoin and like
no one else talks about it at all and the just the way the Facebook pages look
on their screens and the the way that the kids look when they're looking at
their phones like God bless Ariaster for doing the opposite of Robert Eggers
Robert Eggers has never made a modern style a modern age movie and Ariaster has
only ever made now he's only ever shot films that are like of of current
placement in time and no one else is doing that I mean like that was the
criticism from like a couple years ago like PTA and Tarantino and Scorsese are
all just like uncomfortable with tackling right now in a storyline so they just
go to glorified periods in recent history instead whatever sure I bet that's
happening but it's not just like dipshits who are making movies about now
the man that this movie I don't think I cannot believe how it went down

8/10 (I think? Honestly it could be anywhere from 6/10 to 9/10)
