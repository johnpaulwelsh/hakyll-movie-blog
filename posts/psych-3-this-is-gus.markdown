It's cute. It was good to see everyone again, especially Lassiter. The plot is a little weak in this one, and takes a long time to get there (a lot of time is spent before the mystery even presents itself), but the birthing scene at the end is worth it, even if it's the least realistic birth scene I've ever witnessed.

7/10
