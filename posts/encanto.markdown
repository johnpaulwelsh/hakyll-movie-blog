I have nothing interesting to say on the positive side - the movie is quite good. I'm almost annoyed that Disney can make movies like this which are enjoyable and fun and funny and cute and heartwarming. But like, will I want to watch this again over something like _Aladdin_? Probably not. In this sense I think Pixar makes more compelling stories.

The symbolism was so plain as day I was almost offended. And the climax of the movie happened, and then got resolved, so quickly it was like whiplash, especially with the sad Spanish song turning into the overly happy Spanish song right after.

But I have to admit the songs are irresistible. Some of the songs were a bit too music-video-y, but it was never too overwhelming on the senses.

Couldn't help but notice a parallel to _Lone Star_, which also has an older Hispanic immigrant character who holds up impossible standards due to her insecurity about having finally achieved social and economic stability. Man that movie was so good.

8/10
