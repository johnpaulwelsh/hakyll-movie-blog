I have nothing interesting to say on the positive side - the movie is quite good. I'm almost annoyed that Disney can make movies like this which are enjoyable and fun and funny and cute and heartwarming. But like, will I want to watch this over and over again instead of something like _Aladdin_? Probably not. In this sense I think Pixar makes more compelling stories, the emotional core of something like _Inside Out_ or _Toy Story 2_ is much more compelling than in _Encanto_.

The symbolism is so plain as day that I was almost offended. The house broke down because the family is breaking apart due to internal pressures, wow! And the climax of the movie happens, and then gets resolved, so quickly it feels like whiplash, especially with the sad Spanish song turning into the overly happy Spanish song in the very next moment.

But I have to admit the songs are irresistible. Some of the musical scenes are a bit too music-video-y, but it's never too overwhelming on the senses.

Couldn't help but notice a parallel to _Lone Star_, which also has an older Hispanic immigrant character who holds up impossible standards due to her insecurity about having finally achieved social and economic stability. Man that movie is so good.

8/10
