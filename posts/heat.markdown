This is on the IMDb top 250? This is in the _1001 Movies to See Before You Die_ book? I chalk it up to people who see De Niro, Pacino, and Michael Mann all in the same set of credits. This could easily be the most overrated crime drama of all time.

The story doesn't deserve to be 3 hours, it barely earns being 2 hours. The entire first third is BOOOOOOORING and that's a pretty impressive feat.

There are way too many side plots and every single one of them fails to make me care. For example, the ex-con who gets hired as the driver and then dies? I don't know why the movie introduces him with no context so early, and strings his story throughout the first 2/3 of the film, only to unceremoniously kill him during the bank heist. It would be an interesting move if I cared, but I really didn't.

Why are they trying to make me think about De Niro's character by showing him schmoozing the Appalachian girl? All it demonstrates is that he's a douchebag who seems to seek out opportunities to skip out on personal relationships according to his "30 second" rule.

Why is there so much detail about each member of the heist gang? Val Kilmer with the wife and kid, Danny Trejo, the maniac murderer guy... none of them contribute anything meaningful to the movie other than being involved in another thing that happens.

Maybe that goes towards my biggest complaint: _Heat_ doesn't all add up to some kind of coherent whole, there's no theme, or message, or grand statement it's trying to make. The movie isn't _about_ anything except the actual plot points.

Every word out of Christine's mouth is the dumbest dialogue I've heard in a while. It's at its worst during her philosophical musings about why their relationship isn't working out.

I'll admit that it has a cool ending, and especially cool music in those final scenes. And watching Al Pacino freak out on screen is always fun. I think there's a 7/10 movie hidden somewhere in this dull and bloated final product.

4/10
