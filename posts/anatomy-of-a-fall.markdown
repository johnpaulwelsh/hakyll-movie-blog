Really well done, I was prepared to not know the ruling of the trial but an acquittal is more interesting actually because it still leaves open the question of what the truth really is. The most impressive scene is of course the fight that's recorded because it shows the most about the characters, and it validates both sides of the story depending on how you look at it.

I liked when the courtroom scene with the kid being cross examined where the camera goes back and forth from the POV of the people questioning him.

The kid and Sandra were both fantastic actors.

8/10
