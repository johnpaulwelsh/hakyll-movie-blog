_The Matrix_ walked so that _EEAAO_ could run. A high concept sci-fi action film that actually makes sense. This could easily have merely been "brand new sentence, the movie" but they actually make the themes pay off in the end.

Some parts are so ridiculous that it threatens to undercut the sentiment, but luckily I don't think it went off the deep end too often. The middle section has a few too many back-and-forths about what Evelyn's final decision/strategy will be, but it is a minor annoyance.

The idea of stealing talents from your multiverse selves to make the crappiest you become the best you, is honestly a great idea.

If I liked _The World's End_ enough to give it a 10/10, then I can't see any argument for giving this any less.

In a world where God does not exist and honest self-love is the worthiest goal in life, then this movie is kind of perfect. I don't live in that world, but I can still acknowledge perfection where it exists.

10/10
