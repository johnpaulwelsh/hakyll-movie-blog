This movie rules. It wastes no time before the camera starts going bonkers and the set design just pops off the screen in a marvelous way. This movie has a really excellent blend of great little side-scenes or single shots mixed in to the important story scenes, to the point that it feels like everything is instantly memorable.

The acting is superb, especially Marc's and Giana's. Marc has such an expressive face, every scene that has even a slightly comedic tone becomes hilarious with him involved. Special shout-out to the arm-wrestling scene.

The music is awesome, even when it fades out abruptly or feels totally inappropriate for the scene. I actually like that the music lowers the scare factor by making scenes feel more like music videos.

I feel bad for anyone who would get distracted by the terrible lip sync on most characters, they're missing out on a wonderful thriller movie. If _Suspiria_ ends up improving itself in my mind when I get around to a rewatch, then Dario Argento will become one of my favorite new discoveries.

9/10
