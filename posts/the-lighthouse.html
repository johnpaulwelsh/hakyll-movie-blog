        <p>I think this movie wants to be a creepy and ambiguous, but the actual beats of the story feel more like a conventional “he’s going crazy” story, which makes me way less interested in parsing the ambiguity and symbolism for some reason. Overall I enjoyed the film, but I think it didn’t inspire me to reflect as much as it wanted to.</p>
<p>Actually if I had to compare it to something, the first thing that comes to mind is <em>Eraserhead</em>. That movie also has a lot of disturbing imagery, expressive black-and-white photography, droning and mechanical sound effects, and a vaguely sexual undercurrent. But I think <em>Eraserhead</em> inspires more emotion and wonder than <em>The Lighthouse</em> does, maybe because even the typical events are evocative of a greater theme. Whereas this movie seems to be a normal-ish survival drama with some weird stuff thrown in to spice it up.</p>
<p>I can’t believe the 4:3 ratio was a good idea, but for the overall claustrophobic effect it works wonders.</p>
<p>Willem Dafoe as a crusty old sailor man is wonderful.</p>
