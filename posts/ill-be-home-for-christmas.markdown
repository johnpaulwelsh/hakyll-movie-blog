What a stupid stupid movie, but also a perfect cheesy Christmas movie for kids or preteens. Jonathan Taylor Thomas has the most punchable face, Eddie has the most punchable personality, and Ally is a dumbo who shouldn't be interested in either of those clowns. But I can't deny that the scene in the Nebraska steakhouse is hilarious, as is the bus driver later on.

Can someone please tell me if they attend a high school or a college? It has lockers and a dorky kid with braces, but it's titled "college" and the main kid is 18.

8/10
