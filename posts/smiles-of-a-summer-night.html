        <p>This feels a lot like a Shakespeare comedy, and I kind of loved it. Some of the characterizations were inscrutable and almost contradictory, but it goes down easier if you think of them all as exaggerated characters in a story. For example if you think of the son as an embodiment of pent-up sexual frustration, it makes a lot more sense than trying to fit his behavior into a more nuanced framework as if he were really his own human person. It also makes the endless philosophical musings about men, women, love, and age feel less cringey and more self-knowingly theatrical, sort of like the scene in the beginning where the countess in the play is spouting idioms and adages all over the place.</p>
<p>This movie has a great wit, wonderful acting, and somehow it’s an example of “casual adultery played for laughs” that didn’t totally rub me the wrong way (see: all of Charlie Kaufman’s films and <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em>).</p>
<p>The film is so chock-full of themes that I think I’ll take something new away from each successive viewing as I go through life. Right now I latched on the most to the idea of maturing into a relationship, and how seemingly everyone in the movie has a really hard time with it.</p>
<p>I don’t even need to see the remaining 30-something Bergman movies in the Criterion set to know that this is a really great start to the “film festival” sequence, it just felt like a good start to something.</p>
<p>Also this movie is way sexier than I would have expected from something from 1955. I guess I need to start watching more movies from the 50s that weren’t stifled by the Hayes code.</p>
