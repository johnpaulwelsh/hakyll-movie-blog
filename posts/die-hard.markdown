Honestly it's a perfect movie. It's got a lot of 80s charm, but the enjoyment is not dated in the slightest. And it's more of a Christmas movie than I remember it being - there's a lot of Christmasy music worked into the score or playing diegetically.

There are some parts that are legitimately nerve-wracking, like the entry into the air ducts or the jump off the roof with the fire hose. I forgot how beat up John gets in this movie, poor guy.

Alan Rickman gives one of the all-time greatest action movie villain performances. Now that I've seen 14 or 15 James Bond movies I can see why people think Hans Gruber is so great - he's easily better than every Bond villain except maybe one. The way he rolls words off the tongue is so smooth and so... villainous? It's gorgeous.

The bromance between Al and John is really nice to watch. Also it's hilarious that the LAPD start out being total dinguses, but when the FBI shows up they prove to be even bigger morons, enough for the LAPD to wake up and start realizing it.

10/10
