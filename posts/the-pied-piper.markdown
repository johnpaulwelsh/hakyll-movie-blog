Simply amazing. I find it hard sometimes to appreciate the craft of animation because you can basically do anything as long as you have the budget and time to do it. But stop-motion is something else because I can physically see the work that went in to making it. And this is one of the most impressive stop-motion creations I've ever seen, not just because of its quality, but also its ambition and creativity. The town is so jagged and warped, and this isn't even the Tim Burton style where doorwars might be angled, but at least you can believe people walk through them without issue, there is some seriously twisted geometry in here.

I love that the soundtrack becomes this distorted rock guitar after the piper is rejected. I love that they talk in this kind of raspy babbling. I love how they depict haggling, with ghostly coins flying out of their mouths to represent how much they are bidding or asking. I love that the rats are sometimes full-motion video of real rats, and their size is simply unbelievable compared to the townsfolk. That seems like foreshadowing a bit now.

The storyline changes were shocking at first, but I realized that they make more sense with the established tone and themes than the original ending would have. It's hard to depict a Pied Piper story where the kids all get piped away, if you never see any kids, and especially if the town doesn't look like they would value their children even if they had any. This movie so completely establishes that the townsfolk are irredeemable, that the only "just" ending is for them to be destroyed themselves. The only people spared from this fate are a Christian young woman who is raped and murdered (inciting incident), an innocent baby, and an outsider fisherman. There is a lot of Sodom and Gomorrah in this version of the story now that I think of it.

10/10
