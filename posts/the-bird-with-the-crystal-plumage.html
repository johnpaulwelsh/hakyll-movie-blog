        <p>There are some good bits here, but overall it feels pretty light on intrigue and much of the movie is kinda dull. I’m sure if I had seen Argento’s filmography in order I would appreciate this more, but with the knowledge that he later made <em>Deep Red</em> I can only see this as proto-Argento.</p>
<p>The music is pretty good, the whole painting angle is interesting, and the painter himself is hilarious. And I absolutely love the scene when the main guy goes into the killer’s apartment and the lights are out.</p>
<p>But the twist is kinda lame, or at least feels a little obvious once you realize that the rich man couldn’t have been the only killer.</p>
<p>Everything in this movie is done better in <em>Cat o’ Nine Tails</em> and/or <em>Deep Red</em>.</p>
<p>6/10</p>
