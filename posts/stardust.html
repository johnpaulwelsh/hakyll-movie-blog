        <p>It’s pretty good, and quite funny. I bet if I were a 15 year old girl and saw this, I would obsess over it for years.</p>
<p>The movie had the right amount of romantic tension for me to go along with it, and not to just roll my eyes at a premature love confession or something.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of nice little tie-ins to make the ending as happy as possible, like the revelation of who the guy’s mom was.</p>
<p>There are a couple little things they didn’t explain outright, which I bet are well established in the book. I’m mostly thinking of the opening scene about someone writing in to a scientist asking some question that the scientist dismisses. I assume it was the dad writing in after he came back from over the wall, but the movie never says. Also, I just had to guess that the star was dragged down to earth by the necklace as an accident, not because the necklace was specifically designed to lasso stars or something.</p>
<p>The CGI was kind of bad in places.</p>
<p>In fact I bet the book is a 10/10, you can just tell that every scene that’s good in the movie, is probably amazing in the book.</p>
<p>Claire Danes is a wonder of the modern world, how can a person be that beautiful?</p>
<p>If I didn’t know that Robert de Niro was in this movie I would have flipped out when he showed up. His character was great.</p>
<p>The peanut gallery of dead princes was one of the best touches of weirdness that makes the movie charming. I also liked that the witches slaughtered animals to read their entrails, and it’s kinda gross when they do it. Also also, the fact that the goat-man still acted like a goat as a man was excellent.</p>
<p>8/10</p>
