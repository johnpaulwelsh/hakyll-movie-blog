        <p>Electrifying, obviously.</p>
<p>Interesting that Juror 8 doesn’t come out swinging with all his doubts at once. I’m starting to think his only doubt in the beginning is the commonness of the knife, and that the rest of his arguments come from the interplay between him and the other jurors as they review the evidence.</p>
<p>The advertising guy (Juror 12?) is one of the most interesting ones to me, I think his deal is he doesn’t take anything seriously until much later in the conversation. I also like the seemingly unnecessary scene with Juror 1 talking to 8 when it begins raining, it shows that he’s warming up the guy.</p>
<p>The directorial choice to focus on the old man’s face so closely whenever he spoke up was… something.</p>
<p>Also interesting that so much testimony is referred to in the beginning, but all the details are conveniently forgotten. The L train doesn’t even come up except when 8 insists on mentioning it, everyone else seems to have heard “eyewitness testimony” and figured that was good enough.</p>
