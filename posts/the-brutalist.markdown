So I'm driving home from seeing the brutalist in Coolidge Corner Theatre in Brooklyn, Massachusetts. It's a beautiful snowy day except that I have to drive through it. I missed the first, let's say, seven minutes of the movie and I also missed maybe the first two minutes of the second act after the intermission. So I came in basically right as Lasla was kind of going through not-Ellis-Island, but like immigration stuff. And the first thing I really paid attention to was that he visited a prostitute and then gave a hug to his cousin as he got on a bus. And then after the intermission, I came in basically as they were having dinner with Elizabeth or whatever you say.

I'm really glad that I saw it and that I saw it in a theater. What a great theater experience. Everyone, firstly, it was a packed house. I needed to look around when the screen got bright to see where the seats were that I could find. And there was this nice guy on the end that I didn't have to climb over other people to get to him. But there was a seat back to it, so I took his seat, that seat.

And it's, I mean, it's very impressive. And my, I feel a little bit like I felt after _Killers of the Flower Moon_ where my response was like, I understand that this is great. And I liked a good deal of it, but my connection to it was still a little bit at a distance. So it, like, that, because that happens all the time with Scorsese movies, not just _KotFM_, where I, I don't, like, get into it emotionally. And sometimes I don't even get, like, immersed. Like, I think that happens with good fellows every time I watch it.
I'm just like, yep, and then this happened. And oh, that's pretty violent.
But like, it's still good. So like, the brutalist is good.
I suspect that when I go back and watch other highly acclaimed things from 2024, the brutalist will not be my favorite one.
And that's a little bit of a weird thing to admit, given that it's the only thing that I've seen that came out in the year 2024.
But it's, it just doesn't, you know, and there's a little bit of whatever that phrase is, where it's so long that you want it to be the best thing you've ever seen.
I'm not that insecure about it. I think I might have been in the past. But like, let me tell you about what I liked.
I thought, I don't know. I, like, I'm so fascinated by Harrison Van Buren's character.
And I felt that way, like, even before the intermission. I just thought that, like, he's like, maybe my favorite part of me is just the fact that there's this guy who they never like tell you why he's rich.
But you can kind of guess, given that Martin Van Buren was the only Pennsylvania to ever be president. So it's probably just heritage money.
And he has this crazy introduction because he starts storming in and you're like, oh, yeah, he's not going to be the main character. It's going to be his son. But then, you know, he takes over.
And it's just so interesting to watch him. And firstly, the audience of the movie thought he was just the funniest. Like everything he said, they were cracking up.
And I think that just happens when you have a lot of people in the room is things that are a little bit funny, like, get a lot of laughs. It happened when I was watching people in a packed house of old people.
But, yeah, his character is so funny and caricature-ish, but also, like, important.
And, like, I started developing this theory that basically got completely proven after they go to Italy that he kind of just likes having last low around.
And once he discovers that he's interesting, it's very much one of those, like, that's the thing. Like, he isn't, Harrison isn't, like, a commercial guy. Like, he isn't obsessed with having the best of something or, like, how much something is going to cost or, like, he's interested in status.
You know, he wants to, he likes that he knows that he's the kind of guy that'll hang out with this Hungarian immigrant architect genius. But he doesn't seem interested in, like, leveraging that to be, you know, into other people, like, have other people be impressed with him.
Because he doesn't bring him around to, like, a million cocktail parties. But, and he does seem to really want him to work on this project.
The problem is that he's so mercurial and, you know, flips out and has to be reined in and, and it's just so hard for him to be, like, reliable.
And I think, like, if the movie is saying anything generally about being an immigrant or being, you know, ancient American money or the contrast between them, I think it's that, like, you know,
as long as accomplished in his home country or at least I gather it because I didn't see him do anything there if that's what happens in the beginning. And he comes to America hanging out with,
um, an ungrateful cousin and some beggars, basically.
But, like, you're like, okay, so he's going to rise up the ranks. He's going to, like, have the American dream happen to him because it's like, that's like exactly who it should happen to is what you think.
And it kind of does, but, like, you don't, you don't get the sense that Harrison is like a reliable representation of the American dream because he's still giving him a hand out.
Right. Like, Harrison would say, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and mean it and not realize that, like, he might be talking to someone who is smarter than him.
But, the, like, the movie is not about Lazlo starting from nothing and becoming something. It's about having something, getting reduced to nothing.
And then, um, having America, if you want to have him as a, as a archetype, like, say, I will offer you a chance, but you kind of have to play by my rules.
And, like, almost like that he's like a purchasable thing. And that becomes immediately clearer when he rapes him, which that was a very uncomfortable thing to watch in a movie theater full of people.
And so I just find him very interesting. And I love that you, like, never actually find out what happens to him. But, like, it's clear to me that he went and killed himself in such a way where he, it was like this unfinished building is going to be my two.
And then it always, like, as soon as that happens, you realize it always was, like, it always behaved like a two that you just needed. It's just was unclear who was going to be buried in it.
And so it's, and then honestly, I need to skip and talk about the ending.
And the ending is what making me think about Call of the Flower of Moon the most because the ending of that movie is a complete rugpole of, like, how am I supposed to feel about this as an audience.
And it's like the difference between three hours of looking at something from the inside. And then 10 minutes maximum of looking at it from an outsider's point of view.
So it, Lazlo only really gets to speak for himself and his craft, like, maybe twice in the movie, once when Harrison asks him why architecture. And then later, you could argue when he's talking to his wife about how these people, meaning Americans, just don't want us here, meaning Jews, but also foreigners, which I found to be, like,
I think it was a good that they did not keep that subtextual for much longer. I think it's good to just have and say that partially because it showed that he wasn't about to end his marriage.
But also because it was like, yes, no, that is what I've been seeing this whole time. I just didn't have the words for it.

Section two, but when you get to the end, the end is so abrupt, partially because the
music is 80s and because, like, I'm not even really sure where it's set, I guess it's
probably then as based on the gondolas, but it just kind of dumps you into a, you know,
cocktail party, hoity-toity, architectural review, where people stand there and look at models
and smile like they have any idea what they're talking about. And his wife is conspicuously
missing, like, she obviously had passed away by then, but she just never is seen again
after she gets her walker kick down from under her. And his niece spends the whole time
talking about things that we never got to see, but are, like, yeah, now you're seeing,
like, the real last love. So the fact that he was inspired to construct that, that
institute building based on the Dakow camp that Elizabeth was in, like, how, you know,
we never saw him talk to her about that. And then, like, she's talking about how it's
like representing of this. And, like, when you look up, it's going to inspire you. Like,
this is the kind of stuff that you expect to hear or read at an art gallery about the
artist, but I just watched, you know, a pretty sizable snippet of the artist's life. And it,
like, never crossed my mind what higher calling aspirations were informing the way that
he was designing this building. And so it felt, and, and honestly, like, also the little
snippets of digital video, or, and I wasn't digital, but it was, like, camp hoarders,
like, it, it made it seem so fake. And it, and honestly, the, those little slideshow
you see behind her of the buildings that he's made, they all seem fake. They look like
pictures of models. And so it's, and it honestly makes the building ugly. I thought the
building was magnificent looking when they were making it. Maybe that's because you're
seeing it through lassoas eyes. But then when you just see photos, it's like, wow, that
does look like a prison, or a barracks as a Harry junior closet. And so I don't, like,
I think that it might be on purpose that the end is so disorienting and to make you question
whether you really count to no last-low at all. I do think that one of the reasons that
I'm not, however, he doesn't love it, the movie is because I thought maybe the movie
wanted me to be more on his side and more invested in getting to know him than I felt
that I actually did. So my conclusion is maybe I didn't know last-low. Um, instead of
saying, wow, look at this contrast between I do know him, but all these jokers with cameras
in front of them are acting like they know him, but only I do. And, um, to jump around
some more, uh, I couldn't tell I was watching on 70 millimeter. Like, maybe it was just
because it was not like, you know, a digitally projected iMacs thing, but like it felt to
me like kind of just watching a regular old movie. Um, but in a nice, it was nice. There
was a little bit of a flicker whenever there was bright lights in the movie. Um, I think
that's just what happens when you run film through a projector is sometimes the, the frames
are visible, I guess you could say. Um, the music I liked a lot, the fact that there's
kind of like a theme that I picked up on with like this French horns and two, but it's
like, boom, boom, boom, boom. Um, was suitably majestic, but like didn't ever do it. Like,
you don't want that music to make you feel like you're watching Lord of the Rings when
you're clearly not. So they didn't use it too much. Like there was other, weirder stuff mixed
in to give it some variety and not just bash you over the head of this is an epic movie watching.
I was really amazed at the Italy scenes, um, just in general. Like, of course, that's a very
focal point crux of the story, but just the visuals of, um, the quarry and the party inside the
quarry. And it's just like, really amazing. Like, I could have watched a movie set and there's
categories like for two hours instead of just whatever it was, 21 minutes. Um, also there's another
thing that makes me feel a little emotionally distant is that there's things that happen that
seem like they could have turned into their own subplots, but then dull. Um, for example,
Harry, Jr. Being weirdly, um, ambivalent toward, uh, Sophia, I'm just going to say their
angle size names, where he's like, can you get her to stop being such a sourpuss? But you never
see your talk. It's on the, like, the very end of the movie. And then the fact that he clearly
propositions her for sex in the woods and it seems that she goes through with it. And then he says,
never talk to that guy. And then she never does. Like, it kind of just doesn't turn into drama
the way that it could have. And maybe, um, a movie with a smaller focus.

Final part. I think that... I mean, Adrian Brody did a great job. Like, I believe that he was
Hungarian. Basically, as well as anyone. Although, I much more strongly believed that his wife and
niece were really Hungarian, but I doubt that both of them are. I'm not really... I didn't see the
credits, so I don't know who played them. And, like, oh, so another thing, which, like, the fact that it
concludes so late in the movie and doesn't result in tragedy makes his smack addiction and overdose for his
wife. Like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't want to say I wish he died from it, and I don't want to
say I wish that there were more consequences for that element of his life, but, like, for example,
when Harrison finds him shooting up in the catacombs of the quarry, I expected him to be, like, really
mad and to kick him off the project again. Like, oh, it turns out, of course, that this immigrant,
dude, is addicted to drugs and a complete loser, which, like, he does say that, but he says it, like, it
almost is, like, that's his invitation to take advantage of the sky. Like, I almost thought that it
was, like, a blackmail technique where he sees him with drugs and then immediately says, oh, now I can do
whatever I want, and he doesn't speak up because he would, I would be able to say, well, you're on drugs,
so that's going to make your reputation basically ended in the United States. Also, I just realized that
if Harrison dies in whatever it is the 60s, but the buildings completed in 1973, does that mean
that his daughter and son paper things over and work with him to finish it? That's pretty interesting
that that's underneath the plot, but, like, never shown to you. And I also realized, you never see any
footage of people using the building. Like, no one uses it when they're building it, of course, but
then after you learn that it's been built for seven years, because it takes place in 1980 in that
scene, there's no footage or videos of people using it. So it almost is, like, unclear whether it
was ever being used for a stated purpose. Like, they just say, yep, they built it. Here's these
pictures in the slideshow of the empty inside. And I think that means something, too. I think that
means something about, like, the value of inspired architecture in the United States. I don't know,
it, that ending just completely threw a wrench into my feelings in the movie for the better. Like,
I think that if it ended without having a time jump, and especially if it ended without
there being, like, an art gallery scene, I think I would have felt like too much of the story was
telling a story that was just interesting enough, but not, like, making me compelled to fall in love
with it. I don't know. I mean, I'm making it sound like it's like a five out of ten movie that
raised to a six, but it's more like a seven that raised to an eight. But I am pretty comfortable and
confident that there are other movies that I could watch from this year that I might end up liking more.
And I very much look forward to reading reviews that are in the same middle to good
sense that I have been talking about, and also reviews of, like, this is a masterpiece. This is
the best movie in 20 years kind of stuff, because I want to see, like, what are they picking up on?
Not what are they picking up on that I missed, but just what, where does this fall in the grand scheme
of, like, personal dramas that are somewhat also about America? Oh, one last thing.
I think that the whole Israel subplot is, it's good that it's there, but I definitely, like,
felt, like, in the air of the theater that those were, like, points against everybody,
like, that right now it is not a very popular thing to be talking about. The formation of Israel
as a state, and people moving there for their birthright return. And I think it's just, like,
I think that it may complicate the movie more than it needs to. I guess maybe the most valuable
involvement is that, you know, they leave their home country because they're not wanted,
and they also realize that in the United States, they, like, aren't really wanted. But this third
place is like, what really makes it different, what makes it different is they're like us,
right? Like, they, so I, I don't know, I almost feel like it's, if I weren't watching this post
October 7th, I think I would have seen that storyline as more of an obvious like,
like, this is the, this is the positive development in their lives that is complicated, like,
all immigration is, but it's like, yeah, and then his life got better when they went to Israel
because Hungary rejected him and the United States rejected him. But after October 7th and the fall
out from that, it feels more like a question mark. Like, should we welcome this exchange or should we
snidely laugh and say, oh yeah, and you think that you're going to be welcome in Israel too?
Get out of here. River to the sea and all that. And so, I guess that's the end of my thoughts.
Good movie.

8/10
