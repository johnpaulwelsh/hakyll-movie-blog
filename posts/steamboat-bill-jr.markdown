This one is really really good. It starts out a bit slow, which I guess is something you'd expect, but it builds at such a good pace that by the end it leaves a really major impression on the viewer. The jailbreak scene followed by the climactic finale with the wind storm is so strong that I can't help but weight my enjoyment of the whole film based on that second half. I really lost it when Buster rides the tree through the wind, it's so imaginative and ridiculous.

9/10
