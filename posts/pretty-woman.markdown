Put this in the class of "well made 90s movies that make you happy" (_Ghost_, _Sister Act_, etc.). It's also a perfect cast, not just the beautiful-but-relatable Julia Roberts but also Jason Alexander and the concierge guy.

I still can't really figure out why Edward wanted to rent her for a week originally, other than vague "she's interesting" or "I can fix her." and I kinda don't buy that his change of heart in business and life is gonna translate to being a better partner for her than he was for his wife and girlfriend.

The role of Vivian wouldn't work if it were Tina Fey (funny and cute, not elegant) or Audrey Hepburn (funny and elegant not cute) or Natalia Dyer (cute and elegant, not funny).

The costume and makeup departments must have had a field day, playing around with high end clothes and ratty hooker garb.

9/10
