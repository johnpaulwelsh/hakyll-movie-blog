I never expected to like watching dominos fall as much as I did here. I also don't think I need to see domino art ever again, from how much of it there is in this movie. But that comes with the territory, when you learn about something new from a documentary you can sometimes feel burned out on that topic for a little while afterwards.

Lily comes across as kind of shallow in her thinking, but she also is 100% genuine so it doesn't feel like a lame puff-piece like any other movie would that follows a YouTuber around. Seeing her hang out with her friends was my favorite part, especially the blonde girl and the hilariously awkward boy who helps at The Tonight Show.

I never quite got past the thought of, "but how do you make a living out of this?" But hey if the money keeps coming in, then who am I to judge an artist?

Seeing Lily at the Q&A afterwards was insane! It was like, you were just on screen and now you're here, and you sound and look the same!

7/10
