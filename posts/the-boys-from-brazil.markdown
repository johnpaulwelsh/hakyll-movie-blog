Probably a pretty good thriller, but I knew the twist before I even began the film so I was pretty mildly interested for the first 75% of the film. The strange thing is, I thought I learned the twist from an IMDb or streaming service summary of the movie, but now I can't find any evidence of such a reveal. Maybe it used to spoil the plot on IMDb but then they updated it sometime in the last 13 years, since it was in about 2011 that somebody recommended this movie to me.

I like the performance of Gregory Peck as Lieberman, he's funny and cute as an old man.

The finale is pretty exciting, even though it doesn't seem like it would be if it were just described to you (two old men wrestle and a boy sics the songs on one of them).

My internet went out at the exact moment that Mengele was about to shoot Willock. Weird timing.

The sound on this streaming copy of the film is horrendous, not just on Kanopy but on Tubi too and probably everywhere. It sounds like it was passed through a flanger. When the music kicks in or when there's a noisy object on screen, it gets very robotic and muffled.

6/10
