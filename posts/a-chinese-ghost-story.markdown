Ah so this is the kind of movie being referred to in _Big Trouble in Little China_!

It's so ridiculously entertaining. The camera movements and special effects are some of the most exciting things I've watched in a while. There's so much energy in every second of this movie that it makes me mad that American action movies are so static and lifeless in comparison. This has a lot of _Evil Dead II_ vibes, too. The zombies, the tongue, and the flying heads at the very end are my favorite effects.

If I had to find negatives, most of them stem from the absolutely terrible subtitles I watched with. Also the ending is really rushed, they could have afforded maybe two more minutes of bringing the story to a conclusion after the girl moves on. But that's hardly worth complaining about.

9/10
