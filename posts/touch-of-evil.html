        <p>If this is a film noir, then I would say it’s one of the best I’ve seen. My typical issues with noir are the convoluted plots, intentional loose ends, and emphasis on mood over plot, but this film balances the plot and atmosphere in a really satisfying way that never left me confused or bored.</p>
<p>The directing and camerawork in this movie is superb, right from the very first scene. It’s amazing to me how much framing and dynamic camera movements add to the experience. This movie definitely fits the bill of “every frame a painting,” and I found myself looking at various shots and immediately feeling that they were iconic and memorable.</p>
<p>One scene that jumps out at me is when the cops interrogate Sanchez in his apartment. There’s a point where the camera lingers on Vargas as he searches the bathroom and in the background we hear Quinlan threatening, and then beating on, Sanchez. It really emphasizes how Vargas is coming at this from an outsider’s perspective, but it’s clear as day what kind of scummy behavior is going on on the American side of the border.</p>
<p>The acting felt simultaneously modern and old-fashioned at the same time, a pretty interesting combination. Susie Vargas delivers her dialogue with a quick tongue and a sense of humor that definitely feels more from the 70s or 80s rather than the 50s. And the way the characters talk over each other reminds me a lot of _M<em>A</em>S*H_, which obviously came out much later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the acting style that Orson Welles delivers is riding the thin line between authentic and over-the-top. It’s clear that Welles is a powerful screen figure, but I wonder if the role needed to be quite so larger-than-life. The slurred speech and lumbering presence at times felt like a distraction I guess, although it didn’t bother me too much after the first 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I also have to say that I was getting pretty annoyed with the night watchman at the motel. I think he was going a little overboard with the nervousness. But other than those gripes, I was very pleased with the acting.</p>
<p>If I were to revisit this film with a more analytic eye in about five years or so, I think I will find even more to appreciate. Of course, I don’t want to jump onto the bandwagon of worshipping Orson Welles based solely on seeing two of his films (this and <em>Citizen Kane</em> so far). But I will say that for both films, I felt immediate gratification of having watched a good movie, while also sensing that there’s a lot to unpack if I were to watch it again from a film analysis perspective. For the past few months I’ve vaguely wanted to jump in and watch a whole bunch of Orson Welles (both acting and directing/writing) to get a grip on why he is so beloved. I feel pretty satisfied with <em>Touch of Evil</em> and cannot wait to try some more.</p>
