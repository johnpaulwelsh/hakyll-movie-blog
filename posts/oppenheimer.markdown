Saw it in IMAX, the picture was stunning, the sound was TOO LOUD, but luckily the theatre had earplugs available and the clarity of the dialogue was not hindered by the volume or the dampening effect of the earbuds. Apparently the AMC theatre has no control over the volume level, it's set by IMAX. So screw them.

This movie is very good, sometimes great, but I feel about it the way I feel about most Scorsese movies, which is that I can appreciate the genius of what I'm watching but I don't really feel many emotions about it. This is better than most of those examples though.

I could look at close-ups of Oppenheimer and Strauss and the sweaty physicist forever. Such beautiful imagery.

The test of the bomb, and especially the scenes after hearing the news about the dropping of the bombs in Japan, are very affecting, I almost cried because it was so scary to think about.

The music is incredible, maybe the most effective score I've seen in my whole life. It made a three-hour movie feel brisk and exciting for basically the whole runtime, that's a major accomplishment.

Once the flashbacks mostly stop and the focus of the movie is wholly on the trail/hearing, the pace seems to slow considerably. I think it's because the stakes seem so much lower and the plot gets more confusing both at the same time. Building the bomb and testing it is exciting, even if it takes 1.75 hours of build-up to establish that part of the story. And intercutting the political stuff from the future is a very smart way to introduce the boring stuff without it being boring. But then you're only left with the boring part, and now you realize you didn't really remember any of the characters' names when they first showed up in the black-and-white portions, so it forces you to retool your perspective about what's the big deal about this whole hearing.

It's interesting to see a biopic with a clear pair of characters who are adversaries (Oppie and Strauss) but which shows good and bad sides to both of them, without clearly taking one guy's side morally. There are times where I was like "ooooh Strauss you scumbag" but in the next scene I'd remember that Oppenheimer was a pretty unlikeable guy in some ways.

8/10
