This is my _Mean Girls_. A perfect horror-comedy with amazing dialogue, unbelievably stupid characters, and a really strong series of jokes and gags. Movies like this often peter out after the first half but this one kept up the laughs and action the whole time. Put this right up there with _Evil Dead II_ and _Braindead_. The lead devil worshiper's voice made me laugh every single time.

10/10
