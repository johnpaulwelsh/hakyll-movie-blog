Revisiting this was a good birthday present. The CGI is god-awful, I cannot believe that the budget on this was $85 million. The story is almost too complicated, it can't decide if voodoo, ancient rituals, or spirit harvesting is the main thing so they throw it all in at once. The cast is great. The jokes are lame but I still laughed, especially the farting, much to my shame.

6/10
