Rather uneven. The scenes with Hook are magnificent. The scenes with Tink are cringe. The Lost Boys are good, but also chaotic at times. It's a 50/50 with Peter's scenes between good and lame. Some scenes are just totally out of nowhere, like Tink growing big to give him a kiss. It just kind of happens and then doesn't matter anymore. And there's no drama at all when Rufio dies, like Peter saying "you killed Rufio" during the final fight with Hook isn't enough to make me believe it actually mattered. Also, the crocodile falling on Hook and spewing green smoke and Hook disappearing into his mouth makes zero sense.

I will say though that the parenthood themes got to me pretty good. I just keep watching movies with parent/child relationships as central themes now that my daughter is born.

This movie is like _AI: Artificial Intelligence_ where there's a weird split between seriousness and intense whimsy. I think _Hook_ errs too much on the whimsy side, whereas AI frequently errs on the dark side.

7/10
