        <p>First things first, this is NOT A COMEDY. Just because there are a couple laughs doesn’t mean you can slap that genre onto the movie.</p>
<p>In general I had a miserable time watching this movie. I needed subtitles because I couldn’t understand what anyone was saying for the first 40 minutes at least. I also had a difficult time pairing names to faces, to the point where I didn’t know who certain characters were until the final few minutes. Like commander Meredith? I feel like I didn’t see him on screen and know “ah yes this is he” until the two hour mark. And what about the two latecomers, Mr. Blond and the other guy? They show up twice in the whole movie, once when they arrive and once at the end when they make it clear they were trying to marry the youngest daughter.</p>
<p>The beginning is soooooooo boring, I almost wish I didn’t know it was considered a murder mystery because it took so long to get to the point where I’d even see a reason for someone to kill the host of the party. I do think the second half is better, because you already have the prerequisite knowledge about just how many people had motive and opportunity. But it doesn’t actually play around much with the whodunit aspects, because pretty much as soon as the murder happens you start piecing things together about who was the culprit. The “mystery” only seems to last about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>There’s a pretty good movie in here somewhere about the lives of the servants in a large British mansion, but it’s muddied up by a murder mystery that takes far too long to start up, and an overload of characters to keep track of with not nearly enough payoff.</p>
<p>Also in general, I don’t like movies where every single character is an adulterous twat.</p>
<p>3/10</p>
