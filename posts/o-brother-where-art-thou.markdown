It's been a long time since I've watched this movie, and I think it does hold up. But the first half of the film felt pretty underwhelming and scattershot to me. I think most of that came from bad vibes / mood from the circumstances of how I watched it - the baby woke up early from her nap, and my fellow watchers weren't really closely paying attention to the early scenes. But honestly I think once Everett and the gang get to the town and he starts talking to his wife and kids, it becomes really great. There's a coziness and warmth and love coming through the scenes in the town, that of course culminate in that beautiful rendition of "In the Jailhouse Now" and "Man of Constant Sorrow" at the party. Anybody who says the Coen brothers are too cynical and mean to their characters hasn't seen the last third of this film.

I had not remembered where "O Death" was sung, so I was pretty shocked to be reminded that it happens during the KKK meeting. The soundtrack is wonderful, of course, but it luckily still works well in the context of the film too. "Lonesome Valley" especially is so much more powerful with the visuals accompanying it.

9/10
