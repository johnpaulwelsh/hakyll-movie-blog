        <p><em>Robocop</em> is kinda smart, kinda dumb, and all entertaining. It’s like they came up with the central premise of a cop being turned into a robot, decided that it’s a good opportunity to have a million guns and gallons of blood and a surprising number of flying appendages, but then also thought the hero needed to be sympathetic and the villains needed to be cartoonishly evil.</p>
<p>Like many violent 80s movies, there are some parts that are just sickeningly brutal. I’m mainly thinking of the guy who gets shot by the ED-209 at the beginning, and the criminal who gets covered in toxic waste at the end.</p>
<p>Robocop himself is pretty ridiculous. Lumbering around and speaking like a robot, I’m surprised they were able to make him seem cool and not just a slick Frankenstein’s monster.</p>
<p>Every piece of satire was hilarious. I especially liked how the insane news broadcasts build the dystopian future world in such an efficient manner. The commercials felt like segments from <em>UHF</em>, especially the nuclear war board game. My favorite one is the car being called 6000 SUX and only getting 8.5 mpg.</p>
<p>There are some pretty interesting technical details too, like how they show the transition-to-Robocop process entirely through Murphy’s TV-screen eyesight as he’s becoming a cyborg. That’s the kind of touch that makes it clear that the director was not phoning it in on this movie.</p>
<p>In general, the movie is pretty damn quotable. I could easily see this being one of those movies where some people out there have memorized entire scenes because of how great the dialogue is.</p>
<p>And everybody is in this movie! Red from <em>That 70’s Show</em>, Leonard Betts from <em>The X-Files</em>, and Albert and Leland from <em>Twin Peaks</em>!</p>
<p>Fun fact: the violent crime rate in Detroit in 1987 was 2544.88 per 100,000. In 2019, it was 2053.05.</p>
