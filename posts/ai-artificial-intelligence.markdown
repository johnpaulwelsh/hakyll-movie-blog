Here's what this movie is - a bunch of good screenplay ideas crammed into one big screenplay, which could have turned out terribly if not for Steven Spielberg being a genius director. The different elements of this film gave me a kind of emotional whiplash as it jumped back and forth between, but somehow I was mesmerized the entire time.

There are elements of _Pinocchio_ in the story, of course, but _AI_ seems to have also been inspired by _The Wizard of Oz_, _Blade Runner_, and _Brazil_. And just for good measure, I was reminded of some movies that hadn't even come out yet as of 2001, such as _Blade Runner 2049_ and _Synecdoche, NY_. I don't mean to imply that those movies stole from this one, but more to drive the point home that this is a seriously ambitious film.

The special effects were really amazing, especially considering the year of release. The depiction of David and Joe as robots was spot-on excellent acting on the part of Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law. And the last half hour of the story is some of the ballsiest moviemaking I've ever seen.

All of this could have fallen apart under its own weight, if not for Spielberg's ability to inject sentimentality, adventure, and thoughtfulness into every scene he shot. The story's cynicism might have been a better fit for Stanley Kubrick's sensibilities, but I think Spielberg really knocked it out of the park with this one and I think he's the only director who could have done it.

I know these thoughts are a little more disjointed than they are in some of my other posts. But that's because this movie is really hard to talk about without just pouring over every scene and getting stuck on long tangents about the moral dilemmas of advanced robotics, the future of human society, and the meaning of love. _AI_ has a lot to say, and in the end I'm astounded that it was able to say all of it without becoming a steaming pile of crap.

9/10
