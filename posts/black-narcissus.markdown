It takes a while to build up, and sometimes it treads too close to melodrama, but ultimately I think this movie is awesome. It's very clear that this is a film for adults, because it sees a worthwhile story in something so seemingly commonplace as "nuns try and fail to operate a clinic in India." A less mature filmmaking team would try to sensationalize it by making the nuns all writhing with lust or picked off one by one by a murderer or something. As it stands, the enemy here is the world, in the fallen humanity kind of way. The dramatics of Sister Ruth's descent into madness are sensationalized, of course, but putting it next to sister Phillipa's struggle (and other little details) makes me see that they're two sides of the same coin. The world is powerful, and man (or woman as the case may be) is weak. God is greater than both, but I don't see the failure of this religious order as a ding against God's supremacy or the power of his grace. Sometimes things happen regardless.

The colors and sets are just amazing. I never thought I could feel such a shock by seeing a woman wear a red dress as a plot twist. I love the design of the building, there's something mysterious about the loose curtains flowing in the wind. And the romantic paintings and statues everywhere are so captivating, but also menacing because you know what they represent in the eternal conflict.

_Black Narcissus_ is a perfect title, it represents the luxury and temptations of the world.

It's interesting to think that this was made so close in proximity to the British occupation of India. I think of India as a separate country with British trappings left over, but back when this movie was made it was more fresh that this used to be part of Great Britain and now it's not.

9/10
