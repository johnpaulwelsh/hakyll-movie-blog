I actually loved this movie but it's kind of entirely due to style and not substance. There are so many compelling moments, scenes, musical cues, etc. that never really add up to a story that makes sense, even though it feels like it's about to start making sense at any minute. It seems pretty clear early on that Sylvia is nuts and that she killed her mom, but I was afraid that it would try to make it some big twist ending without addressing the whole question of why would Sylvia be surprised by a fact from her own history. Almost like the twist in _Four Flies on Grey Velvet_, another Mimsy Farmer film, where she was raised as a boy by her abusive dad but apparently her cousin doesn't know about this? But anyway in this movie they don't really try to make Sylvia's inner thought process visible, she kind of acts crazy the whole time and it's not a reveal to herself that she's crazy, so that plot element gets a pass from me.

I was so intrigued by the tunnel scene halfway through, it really made me feel paranoid that every one else in movie is in cahoots against Sylvia for some mysterious reason. Then the payoff of that scene at the end is so bizarre and evocative that again, I should be pissed off, but I just really liked it.

This movie is excellent at getting across the feeling of being afraid of being alone in an apartment at night. The fact that Sylvia never seems to turn any lights off, she's always blasting every light in the house even when she sleeps, that's so real. It's also anti-scream-queen, usually you're yelling at the horror movie girl to turn some damn lights on but in this film, Sylvia happily obliges!

NOTE: After reading more about the film, apparently it's about a conspiracy to sacrifice Sylvia so a lot of the "hallucinations" that she experiences are actually staged? That makes me really want to watch it again, but doesn't affect my enjoyment of the movie the first time, which is still mainly based on how cool the images and sounds are.

9/10
