Really enjoyable and very funny. Honestly I found it almost distractingly funny, the comedy-drama element felt much stronger to me than the farce element. Especially the part where Jojo kicked Hitler in the balls out the window (seemed like an applause line), or the fact that all the German soldiers are incompetent or desperate for manpower.

Jojo's mom is a really surprising character, she's totally unhinged but also really endearing.

I haven't seen a movie look this good in a long time. The colors and framing are amazing.

David Bowie recorded "Heroes" in German? That's awesome!

8/10
