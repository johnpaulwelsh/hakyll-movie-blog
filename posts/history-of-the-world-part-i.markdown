This was a very silly movie. It's really just a series of skits, some don't go on for long enough (Moses) and some go on for far too long (deciding whether Josephus is a eunuch).

The Inquisition is probably the best part, because the lyrics are genuinely funny and the energy is undeniable.

Overall I think the sex jokes were too numerous, especially in the Rome and French Revolution parts. The latter had too many cleavage and "king is pervy" jokes.

6/10
