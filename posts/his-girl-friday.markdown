A whirlwind of a movie, maybe the most dense dialogue that I've personally experienced. At first it was almost overwhelming and seemed forced, but once the murderer story gets going I was definitely along for the ride. It took a while for me to laugh, most of the movie was smile-inducing instead of outright laughter-inducing, but once I did it was almost continuous, especially once the murderer gets inside the desk.

The little moments of seriousness are very powerful, like when the press room get called out by Molly and they are all solemn and quiet for what seems like forever as the camera pulls back to show them all in tableau.

Cary Grant has such a ridiculous face, in his first few scenes I thought he looked like he was made of wax.

The star here is obviously Rosalind Russell, I've never seen the female lead carry the film quite like this, at least not pre-1970.

8/10
