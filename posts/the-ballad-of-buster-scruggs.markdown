The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

This is the closest the Coen Brothers will get to making a Quentin Tarantino western. The most obvious comparison is that the violence is surprising, brutal, and pervasive, but the overall tone is much more of a direct pastiche rather than a tweaked entry in the genre, which is what the Coens usually do. This segment probably has the most direct message and reason for being - some westerns are bloody, some are cheery, and wouldn't it just be the most hilarious thing to make those two facets coexist?

Near Algodones

The weakest segment by a long shot. The bank robbery was funny and the hanging was poignant, but everything in between dragged on and didn't have a strong drive behind it.

Meal Ticket

The most short-story-ish out of the bunch. There's a lot of symbolism and metaphor going on, especially because the thespian doesn't speak except during his performances, and his manager can say so much with just a glance and a sigh. The ending was almost too depressing, but it reminded me a lot of the kind of dreary short stories that they seemed to have a lot of at the turn of the century, like "Bartleby the Scrivener."

All Gold Canyon

This is probably my favorite segment because I went through such a large spectrum of feelings while watching it. I began by lamenting the intrusion of humans onto the pristine location, but then I started rooting for the old man once it became clear how methodically he was going about his mission. Then I felt a deep sense of respect and peace while witnessing a solitary man work towards a concrete goal - it's pretty much exactly the typical male fantasy of self-sufficient manual labor in the wilderness, but I don't mind admitting I'm a sucker for it sometimes. The drama intensifies and then dissipates with just the right pacing, so that I had time to mourn the man's "death" and celebrate his triumph. The animals coming back to the stream was a beautiful way to end it.

The Gal Who Got Rattled

An absolutely precious little story, and one of the most convincing romances that the Coens have pulled off. Had the best mix of humor, sadness, and excitement out of all the segments. I this could have worked as a feature-length film.

The Mortal Remains

The Coen Brothers write some of the most compelling short scenes in the entire film industry. Never is this more evident than in this segment. It reminded me a lot of the opening scene to _A Serious Man_ because of its allegorical tone and vaguely supernatural presentation. Aside from the fascinating character portrayals, the cinematography and the music are real highlights here.

Overall

I was surprised how straight the Coens portrayed the Indian encounters. I don't think they overplayed or underplayed the role that roving bands of Indian played in the daily life in the Old West.

I think ultimately the stories are each better than the movie as a whole - it probably would have worked better as an anthology series rather than an anthology movie. I think the only inter-story transition that didn't feel jarring was between segments five and six.

What is the frontier that the Coens want to portray with these six stories? I think it's intentionally hard to pinpoint the answer. It feels unfair to just chalk it up to "an exercise in style" because I think some of these stories have real substance as well.

8/10
