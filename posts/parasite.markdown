A movie about class that isn't preachy or obvious, but still makes you think. I knew once the sister got a job that something suspicious would happen once the whole family was working for the rich folks, but what ended up happening was a total surprise. I'm glad they let the story unfold as naturally as possible once that turn occurs.

Also one of the prettiest movies I've seen in a while. All the actors were gorgeous, and the color and cinematography were excellent.

9/10
