I have such love for this movie. The special effects are pretty good to a modern adult's eyes, but as a kid they are truly magical. I think the painted backgrounds help with that somehow.

The songs are instant classics, every single one of them. I am very moved by the song where Bert sings to Mr. Banks about him not being there for his kids. And _Let's Go Fly a Kite_ makes me want to cry too.

10/10
