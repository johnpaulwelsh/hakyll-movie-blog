        <h2 id="good">Good</h2>
<p>The fight scenes once inside the caves were all excellent. The ones before that were okay, but they had some anime bullshit mixed in (mostly Assassin vs. Kirei). Illya’s infodump about Angra Mainyu was nicely done too, much more interesting to have a city-walking montage than just sitting in Shirou’s house the whole time. And the music was fantastic, especially during the fight scenes.</p>
<h2 id="bad">Bad</h2>
<p>Some plot points were totally glossed over, so there’s a lot of things that do in fact have their own logic but seem to just be thrown in for coolness factor because of bad presentation. Some examples include the flashbacks to the initiation of the Greater Grail, any mention of The Root, what Heaven’s Feel actually means (it’s a dress that does magic), what Illya does at the end to destroy Angra Mainyu (see previous point). Also the way they got Shirou to “come back” at the end, even though his “body” is missing. That’s a little thing, but without any outright explanation about what that white dummy body does, it just seems like a happy-ending cop-out. Which it kinda still is, but not nearly as much as it seems to be in the movie.</p>
<h2 id="ugly">Ugly</h2>
<p>Everything I don’t like about the <em>F/SN</em> series is found in spades in this movie. So much dumb-ass dialogue that doesn’t mean anything, like half-finished sentences that seem kinda related to the previous conversation but often just feel like nonsense musings. Complete lack of consistency or clarity on the part of Sakura’s character, which is even addressed directly by Tohsaka at one point. And maybe worst of all, this movie solidifies my theory that Kirei is a 12 year old boy’s idea of an interesting antagonist. I always thought his motivations were kinda dumb in the VN, and they’re even worse in the movie. His whole “pleasure is pain for me, I need to bless the birth of this monster, who am I to call it evil before it’s born?” thing is mega cringey.</p>
<p>Side note, I found an IMDb review that totally hits the nail on the head. I thought the fight scenes were better than he gives them credit for, but otherwise I 100% agree with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6285024/?ref_=tt_urv">this guy</a>.</p>
