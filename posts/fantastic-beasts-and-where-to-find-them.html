        <p>I am officially sick of prequel movies that are more extravagant than their source material, but also have much lower stakes in the grand scheme of things and suffer from weaker stories overall. <em>The Hobbit</em> is a well known offender, but allow me to count <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> in that category as well.</p>
<p>Much like in <em>Deadpool 2</em>, there is simply too many things being destroyed. Every ten minutes something is exploding or being put back together after an explosion. It’s even more annoying because everything is cleaned up using magic and everyone gets Obliviated, so I can’t even feel bad for the no-majs who have to suffer through all the mayhem since it gets reset anyway.</p>
<p>But the movie fails hardest in the story and drama department. When Scamander isn’t being the most predictable naturalist in the world (something something humans are the most dangerous creatures of all), everyone else is being equally bland and obvious. Not everybody was terrible (I liked Goldstein and Kowalski), but nobody really stood out to me because of their glowing personality. And I usually don’t complain about skin-deep romances in movies that aren’t focused on the romance, but Kowalski and the dippy girl had just about the fastest meet-to-kiss acceleration I’ve ever seen and it felt totally unearned.</p>
<p>In trying to make a plot with surprise twists and high-intensity action, I think the screenwriters left in some pretty large inconsistencies. Like after the wizards all blow apart the smoke boy, it seemed like the perfect time for someone to make a big speech about how horrible it was that they did that. But all we get is Scamander getting a little annoyed, and then the laziest plot twist reveal about Grindelwald that they could have cooked up. Everyone seems to forget about the people who actually die in this movie - the senator, the abusive lady, and two of the kids she takes care of all get killed, but maybe two people total seem to give a rat’s ass about them.</p>
<p>All of that being said, I was charmed by the actual beasts. The little Groot, the Thunderbird, the big rhino thing, and even the platypus thing were all pretty cool-looking and they fit well with the existing <em>Harry Potter</em> world.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’m not too interested in seeing the sequel.</p>
