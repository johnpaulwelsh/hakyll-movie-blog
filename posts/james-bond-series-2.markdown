**8) _Live and Let Die_ (02.14.21)**

There was a little part of my mind that was worried about all these black characters in a Bond movie. It seems right on the edge of exploitation, especially with all the voodoo stuff, but in the end I was much a bit more offended by the yellowface in the earlier movies.

Roger Moore is a fine Bond in his first outing.

Solitaire is a really great Bond girl, partly because she gets more characterization than most others do. She's also beautiful, but that's par for the course. And she doesn't get mercilessly killed at the end, thank goodness!

The movie gladly sidetracks itself during the speedboat sequence by throwing in the most over-the-top caricature of a southern sheriff ever. But it's so funny, and the stunts themselves are so impressive, that I don't think it hampers the film in any way. This is how you spice up aquatic action sequences (pay attention, _Thunderball_).

The _Live and Let Die_ musical cues throughout the film are probably the best use of theme music in the series so far. The song has so many memorable chords and melodies that you can sprinkle it in anywhere, and not only will it fit, but it will also be memorable.

8/10

**9) _The Man with the Golden Gun_ (02.20.21)**

A lot of little things conspire to make _The Man with the Golden Gun_ my least favorite Bond movie so far. Bond is kind of a jerk, especially with his interactions with Goodnight. Goodnight herself is another ditzy companion, although she's probably not the dumbest one so far. It was totally unnecessary to bring back J.W. Dinglehopper from Louisiana, although I enjoyed his involvement in the car chase a lot more than his boat ride and elephant escapades.

Not to say it was all bad. Christopher Lee is a great villain, the scenery is great, the action is well-choreographed and varied, and the silly spy stuff is very enjoyable (I just about lost my mind when the car attaches to the plane and takes off into the sky).

6/10

**10) _The Spy Who Loved Me_ (02.27.21)**

For some reason this is the first movie in the franchise that I don't have much to say about, other than "it's fine." Jaws is probably the most memorable villain henchman so far, even if they seem to have crafted him to be exactly that (he never even dies!).

7/10

**11) _Moonraker_ (04.25.21)**

Some of the best set pieces in the whole Bond franchise so far. The skydive and the ambulance ride in particular are my favorites, but honestly the action sequences basically never stop and each one is memorable in some way.

But man, this movie is STUPID. Unlike some of the late-Connery-era movies that are stupid because they're gaudy and in bad taste, this one is stupid because it doesn't feel any shame about ramping it up to the next level every five minutes. The fight in the glass factory and all the space stuff at the end are perfect examples of what I mean.

However, I'd like to think this is the first movie where they knew to make fun of themselves a little. They must have read Ian Fleming's original story and been like, "We can't do this one yet, it's too idiotic," so they put it off until number 11, and then just went all-out with it. There's something to admire in that.

And like... Jaws and Mrs. Jaws!!! What a wonderfully stupid plot development, I loved every bit of it.

But what happened to the young lovers on the spacecraft? I hope they didn't die.

There are also probably too many girls in this one, even though most of them just look pretty in the background whenever Drax is involved in a scene. It still feels like a larger cast of beauties than is really necessary.

8/10
