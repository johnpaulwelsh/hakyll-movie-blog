Three and a half hours flew by, that's one of the most impressive things about this movie. Going into it while knowing a bit of the story was helpful too, it gave more satisfaction to the framing device of the car trip that takes up much of the movie.

The de-aging technology is pretty amazing, especially for Al Pacino.

There are some bottom-of-screen-text moments that feel random compared to the rest of the examples, like the name of that Italian family under Russ's wife's name during the car ride (I think). And I didn't quite follow the stuff about Crazy Joe.

There's something about gangster movies that often feels very conventional, hard to elevate to true "art." This is no exception: technically I have nothing to complain about, but it didn't hit me as transcendently good, it's simply very well done.

8/10
