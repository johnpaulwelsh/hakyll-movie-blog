Nearly perfect. All the obvious stuff related to "it was a play before" is excellent of course, like the plot, acting, suspense, etc. But the directing is worth pointing out as well. So many clever bits of framing and camera movements. So much good physical comedy, especially from the wife who was a total riot to watch. The personalities of the characters are very strong and memorable. The psychic is an all time classic chaos agent. The music is kinda corny but also gets wacky enough to contribute to the fun.

I massively enjoyed this. Basically laughed my ass off when they kiss and it becomes clear they offed the wife because they're gay lovers, it was such a delightful twist.

9/10
