This one was really cute. Some of it was too "wink wink nudge nudge" with the references, but enough of it was sufficiently subtle where I enjoyed it without cringing.

The friendship theme was appropriate and actually kinda touching near the end. Also they somehow kept it PG-rated even though there is quite a lot of horrible stuff on the internet.

8/10
