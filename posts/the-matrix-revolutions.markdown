If anyone thought _The Matrix_ was a smart sci-fi premise with an action story underneath, this movie shot down that plane pretty handily. This series clearly stopped caring about making the story more compelling by the time it got to the final entry. Every scene of story-related dialogue is vague and meaningless, especially in the scenes with the Oracle.

I guess you can praise the movie for its action scenes, and they are pretty spectacular, but their impact is undercut by the fact that the audience doesn't have much of a reason to care anymore. Neo's special mission is barely explained until the very end, so the stakes feel weirdly low and high at the same time.

I thought _Reloaded_ was also a dumb movie, but it was fun-dumb because the fight scenes are almost entirely chases and kung-fu. _Revolutions_ is like 50 minutes straight of machine guns, and it doesn't exactly get tiresome, but it certainly doesn't feel that fun to watch. And when there's finally hand-to-hand fighting, it's two Supermen flying around like goofballs in the rain.

Every word of dialogue between Neo and Trinity is cringe, what is this, _Attack of the Clones_?.

Once again, the highlight of the film is Hugo Weaving hamming it up as a million billion Agents Smith. I especially like the good guy who gets taken over by Smith, he does an excellent Hugo Weaving impersonation.

I can't imagine what would occur in the upcoming fourth entry. I feel like they are going to make the story more convoluted and high-concept, which could backfire enormously. People seem to think _The Matrix_ series is best summarized by the 40-ish minutes in the first film where the true nature of the world is revealed. But the series is really better summarized by the fight scene in the garage in the last third of _Reloaded_. It's just trying to be flashy and cool, and the sci-fi / existential story is just an excuse to have more flashy cool stuff happening. So adding more story might expose the fact that _The Matrix_'s story was never that good to begin with.

5/10
