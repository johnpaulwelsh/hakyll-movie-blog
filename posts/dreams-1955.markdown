A very good drama. At first I was thrown off by the two-protagonist angle, but then I started to see the parallels between their stories. It's like two short films tacked together, and almost like a road movie in the sense that a pair of women take a trip together and have different adventures which bring them to a similar conclusion, and bring them closer to each other as well.

I see them both as women who have hopeless men in their lives. Doris and Susanne seem to learn the same lesson from different angles, which is that flattery and good feelings can't hold up against the intrusion of real life that can ruin their dreams. Oh man I just figured out the point of the title! So anyway they fight through their dreams and come out healthier and happier on the other side.

There are some parts near the beginning that are dreadfully boring, but once Doris meets the old man it starts picking up and stays there until the end. The scene in the hotel is pretty fantastic too.

8/10
