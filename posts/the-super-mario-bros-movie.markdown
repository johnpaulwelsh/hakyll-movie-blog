Pretty much exactly what it should be, and what I wanted it to be. It's funny, loaded with references, and just enjoyable to watch. Mario games aren't good because they have a solid story, they're good because they're fun to play. So all this movie needed to be was fun to watch, and it is.

Somehow they got across the feeling of playing a platforming game, especially in the first half when Peach and Mario are jumping around like crazy people.

And the karts! They really got the vibe of playing Mario Kart, and a lot of the details of Super Smash Bros. too (like DK's fighting moves).

The music was also top-tier, there was something magical about hearing those musical cues in a movie setting with full orchestration. But not like an orchestral cover - those usually don't do anything for me, like what you can find with Zelda score played by an orchestra.

Also Bowser was kind of perfectly goofy, thank goodness for Jack Black.

Suicidal insane Luma is the most obvious "for the adults" part of it, but I don't care I still loved it.

8/10
