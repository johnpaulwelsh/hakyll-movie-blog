The whole time I was watching this movie I was comparing elements of what I saw against the baseline that was set up in the first movie:

"Huh, I thought this would have more action given how actiony the first one was."

"Huh, I thought this would be a more complex story given how thought-provoking the first one was."

But then at various points later in the movie, I totally reevaluated those assumptions because even though I had seen it only a few weeks prior, I apparently remembered _nothing_ about the first movie:

"Wait a minute, the first one had huge chunks where it was just people talking. This movie has a perfectly reasonable amount of action."

"Wait a minute, the first one has a fairly simple premise too, and all the complexity comes from academic discussion about whether Deckard is a replicant or not. Both stories are equally digestible for the audience so I don't know why I should be complaining."

The good news is, while this war raged in my head I was also enjoying the movie quite a bit. I loved the slow pacing, the giant scale of the scenery, the colors, and the sound. There were some points where I was caught off-guard by how simple and single-layered some of the plot developments were (including the twists at the end). But as a result of that back-and-forth I mentioned earlier, I eventually decided that even an uncomplicated story can have a lot to say in terms of theme. The detachment from reality that technology provides, the scummy city environment, the questions of identity and purpose - all of them are there even if the story isn't forcing the questions down your throat.

I will admit that some of the plot elements felt like they drifted apart from each other, maybe as a result of how long each scene goes on for. By the time the bad guy starts meeting the protagonists face-to-face I had forgotten about all the other intrusions he had made in the earlier parts of the story. So in a way the stress of the final act was dampered a little for me.

Overall I was pretty impressed with _Blade Runner 2049_. When I first heard mention of a 2.5-hour sequel to a well-respected sci-fi film from almost 40 years ago, I was convinced it could only be an unmitigated disaster. But after watching it I think it's a fine followup to the _Blade Runner_, even if it isn't the earth-shattering cerebral spectacle that it seemed like it could have been.

7/10
