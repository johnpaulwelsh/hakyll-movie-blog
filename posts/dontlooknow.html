        <p>Wow, this movie was really frustrating in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>First off is the sound mixing, which is simply dreadful and feels really amateurish at times. I swear, there were some parts at the beginning where the ambient sound effects in the scene completely overpowered the husband’s dialogue, to the point where I needed to put subtitles on for the remainder of the movie. In my book, I shouldn’t need to put on subtitles to enjoy a movie that’s in English. It was also really obvious that they dubbed his dialogue in after the fact during some of the more action-y scenes, like when he’s trying to rescue his daughter from drowning or when he’s hanging from the scaffolding in the church. It was really distracting to hear every “uuggghh” and “whooooah” with crystal clarity, when all the other talking was mixed in the background where it belonged.</p>
<p>Next is the camerawork - I couldn’t wrap my head around it. Scenes that didn’t seem to matter were shot like the cameraman was on cocaine: constant zooming in an out, sweeping back and forth while in close-up on someone’s face or on some kind of mundane object, and the like. And some of the visual effects that were used to instill a mysterious or emotional tone usually came off as arbitrary or silly. Like a shot where Sutherland is climbing the scaffolding and a short overlay of the blind woman cackling appears - why is that in the movie? Does it imply that she’s cursed him, or that she’s watching it happen through her sixth sense, or what?</p>
<p>And that leads into my biggest complaint about Don’t Look Now. There were just so many pointless and vague scenes that didn’t really add up to either a cohesive story or a really effective mood of unease. For every time something was being legitimately creepy or mysterious, there was a scene that completely didn’t compute with everything else going on, like when the blind woman and her sister are cackling in their room and no one is there. Or when she gropes her breasts and moans during the “seance.” Or when they are weirdly insistent on the husband and wife taking a shot of whiskey whenever they enter the hotel room they stay in. This applies to other characters too. For example, why was the police chief act so suspicious when he was talking to the husband if he didn’t end up mattering to the story at all?</p>
<p>What is the point of this story? It seemed like the movie would address themes of obsession or grief after the death of a child, or some other kind of metaphorical theme that could stand next to all the spooky stuff. But the wife ends up being fine after like 20 minutes of talking to the creepy sisters, and then the husband starts hallucinating. And for what payoff? The movie could pretty much be summarized as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sad couple go to Venice</li>
<li>Wife meets a psychic who can see their dead daughter</li>
<li>Psychic warns wife that her husband is in danger</li>
<li>Husband dies to random act of dwarf-violence</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything in between is needless ambiguity and shots of the characters walking around Venice.</p>
<p>Some of the visuals were really good, I will admit. And the general mood of the back alleys in Venice were quite menacing, almost reaching the point of “the setting being a character.” I’ve never really bought into claims such as that, since it usually means too much attention is drawn to meaningless mood shots of the filming location. But in this movie it more or less worked - Venice seems old, creepy, and somewhat menacing. The smoky atmosphere in the climactic scene at the end was beautifully shot and I wish more was done with it. However, I do feel like the little person in the red trenchcoat at the very end would have been a better ending to a different movie - in this one it feels like a cop-out.</p>
<p>Also, the sex scene was one of the only things I knew about the movie going in, and honestly it doesn’t belong in the film at all now that I’ve seen it.</p>
<p>Overall it’s not the worst movie I’ve ever seen, but it honestly felt like a second-rate Twilight Zone story about a vague curse or haunting, stretched over two hours. If this is a genre classic then I don’t understand why.</p>
