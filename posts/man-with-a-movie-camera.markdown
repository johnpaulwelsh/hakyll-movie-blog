If there weren't a description at the beginning stating what kind of experiment this is, I don't think I'd appreciate this film as much.

It forced me to think of filmmaking from a technical point of view in a way very little has done for me before.

The juxtaposition is really striking. Manufacture and sales; sleeping and vision, marriage, divorce, and vehicle movement.

How did they do all these techniques in 1929? Split screen, stop motion, flickering editing, slomo, freeze frame, reverse footage how, layered images...

This film contains a focus on the cameraman that feels revolutionary, but it's still somewhat artificial because there's another cameraman behind the camera that's capturing the image. That's a fun little thing to think about.

How do you even rate this?

8/10
