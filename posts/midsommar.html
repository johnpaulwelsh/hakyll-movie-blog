        <p>I think I could have watched this movie forever, once it got to the first dining scene I was spellbound and felt no real passage of time.</p>
<p>Overall I think the story is actually a very simple one. A girl loses one family, and gains another. I really like it when artsy movies are compelling all the way through, but also can be brought down to a very simple idea in the end. Honestly I think this movie has a really happy ending, all things considered.</p>
<p>I also appreciate the bravery of showing full frontal nudity in a matter-of-fact way instead of “artfully” hiding the dong.</p>
<p>There are so many little elements that make the atmosphere dreamlike as the movie rolls on. I was especially disturbed by the moving greenery and flowers after Dani is crowned May Queen. Super uncanny. Also when the dance around the maypole is getting close to the end, and the girls are able to communicate with each other through dance and break through the language barrier, it was a really nice trippy addition to the whole thing. It makes you not sure if you can trust what you’re watching.</p>
<p>And it’s amazing how much exposition and intrigue is established by just lingering on drawings on the walls. Like the “love potion” story on the tapestry, or the etching of the bear on fire. Not subtle exactly, but restrained.</p>
<p>I’m happy that actual Scandinavians were involved in making this movie. I didn’t necessarily expect it, but some part of me was afraid the movie would be one long excuse to be like, “hey look at how brutal this made-up pagan cult is!” but in a culturally unfair way. As the movie went on I stopped feeling that way because the brutality and scary parts are never tinged with malice. Like it’s not like they all turn mean at one point and say “you shouldn’t have come here” or something corny like that.</p>
<p>I think I knew that as soon as they mentioned a May Queen, that Dani would win and she would become fully assimilated into the group. So in a way you could say nothing about the main beats of the story were surprising. But all throughout there are a bunch of wonderful smaller surprises. Like the realization that this group experiences all feelings communally, including pain and sexual pleasure. It made perfect sense in my head when the commune members are wailing as people they are watching experience suffering, and moaning when the deflowering is taking place.</p>
<p>When Christian is sitting at the table and sticking out like a sore thumb and probably having a really bad time emotionally, I felt that. I was nervous-shaking a little because of how effective that sequence was.</p>
<p>Florence Pugh is a master at crying and looking grieved.</p>
<p>This movie made me absolutely hate grad students.</p>
<p>Nearly every line that Mark spoke is hysterically funny.</p>
<p>This is one of the prettiest movies I’ve ever seen, the setting, colors, and sweeping shots are all so bold.</p>
<p>And the music is absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
