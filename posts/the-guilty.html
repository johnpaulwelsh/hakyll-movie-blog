        <p>What an outstanding film.</p>
<p>The editing is some of the best I’ve seen. It really felt like I was in the room with him the entire time, it was all so natural. Somehow 90+ minutes of mostly-still shots of a man on the phone never got boring and I never became too aware of the editing itself. It seamlessly blended together the entire time and that’s quite an achievement.</p>
<p>I really don’t have much else to say. The story was perfect, the acting was perfect, and the craft was perfect.</p>
<p>10/10</p>
