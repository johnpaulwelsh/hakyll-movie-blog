I don't get it. More than maybe any other film I've watched, this was just not enjoyable. There's definitely some kind of plot but it's boring. The startling moments of humor (the minister of the interior shooting himself and ending up on the ceiling, the man shooting the boy with no consequences, the toe sucking, the monstrance in the taxi, the cow) feel like random blips of light in a swirl of darkness. If this is supposed to be a satire then I seriously don't understand what it's making fun of. And the drum music for the last 5-10 minutes is so irritating that even if what I was watching was good, it would lose points due to the incessant noise. My favorite part was learning about scorpions.

1/10
