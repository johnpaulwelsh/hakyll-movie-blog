What is a Tarantino movie? "Cool" and "violent" are the first two words that come to mind, but those aren't obvious word choices for _Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood_. There is some violence, and some characters are cool beyond cool (Brad Pitt in particular), but it seems like he's going for something else with this one.

So what is that? Forgive me for making comparisons, but that's where my mind goes with this one. _OUAT...IH_ is less character driven than _Inherent Vice_, another film set in 70s California with a zany cast and a flimsy plot. It's also less obsessively interesting than _Boogie Nights_, another epic-length film focused on 70s-era movie stars and the ups and downs that come from existing in that time and place. It feels like there are vignettes, but they don't stay separate enough nor come together seamlessly enough for me to think it's his next _Pulp Fiction_, although that's the film that it most reminds me of in general. It definitely seems that Tarantino is trying to say something with this movie, the way Paul Thomas Anderson was saying something with those previous two films. But all I can come up with is that Tarantino wanted to surprise the viewer by restraining his impulses for bluntness. I just don't know if what's left over is actually worth it. This will be viewed as a unique chapter in the Tarantino saga, but as a moviegoing experience it's just alright.

One of the biggest problems I had with this movie was actually my lack of prior knowledge of the Manson murders. In reading about the film afterward, so many elements fell into place that I'm almost mad at myself for not having the requisite knowledge to have gotten it during the actual movie. I didn't even make the connection that "Charlie" was THE Charles Manson until I saw the credits and all the hippie girls were lumped under the "Manson 'Family'" category.

In every way other than writing and pacing, the movie is pretty phenomenal. Leonardo DiCaprio does a kickass job with his role, especially in the long movie-within-a-movie scenes. Brad Pitt made me laugh with pretty much every line and action he executed. The rest of the cast fell into the background for me a little (other than the little girl on the movie set who is amazing). The music is excellent and (afaik) has no anachronisms, which helped my enjoyment of the overall aesthetic a lot â€“ the way I see it, if Tarantino is going to make a period piece he might as well do it right. The visuals are stunning as well, and I would be willing to bet a pretty penny that it was shot on film and not digitally, because the warmth of the picture really helped sell the vintage look of the costumes and environment.

7/10
