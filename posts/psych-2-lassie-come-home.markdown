Somehow, this one is even better than the first movie. The jokes are funnier, the plot has more honest emotion, and it feels more like a "back to normal" long-form episode and less like a gimmicky "now we're a movie" kind of deal.

Writing a stroke into Lassie's storyline was a really creative and heartwarming way to explain why Timothy Omundson looks and acts that way (since he really did have a stroke).

I thought I was going to hate the Mary Lightly cameo when it started, but it was actually one of the funniest parts of the whole movie.

Also, we got to see Charlie and Toby from _The West Wing_ hang out again!

9/10
