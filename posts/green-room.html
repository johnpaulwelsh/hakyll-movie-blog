        <p>There’s something really emotionally confusing about this movie. I think part of it is how casually some characters die, compared with how surprisingly brutal other parts are that aren’t necessarily related to those deaths. It almost feels like a video game where some story beats are scripted and others are just happening due to systems at work in the game world. There are also a lot of scenes (especially near the end) that strike me as really naturalistic and not dramatized, but it results in a weird feeling where I appreciate what I’m watching while also not feeling the “love.” Overall I think I liked the movie and there were some parts I thought were really cool, but it may not end up sticking with me for very long. Almost like <em>Blue Ruin</em> but I thought that one was a lot more deliberate which made it more satisfying to watch.</p>
<p>I really like that the neo-Nazis are so organized, whereas everything that happens in the green room is chaotic and unpredictable. It actually cracked me up how many times they leave to go fight Nazis, get totally owned, and then run back to the room to regroup and come up with another plan.</p>
<p>I also really like how smoothly the movie evolves from a tense drama to a bloodbath horror-action film. There’s one particular shot when the gang is walking past the bar near the door, where I realized that this building became basically a spooky slaughterhouse gradually over the previous 45 minutes by a slow escalation of events.</p>
<p>Also, literally everyone is in this movie! I had no idea the cast was going to be so recognizable, although to be fair it took until nearly 3/4 of the way through for me to be sure that I’d seen Imogen Poots somewhere before, and that it really was Patrick Stewart with a beard.</p>
