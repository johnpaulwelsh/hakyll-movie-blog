        <p>My lord, this movie was funny. I love that all the characters were parodies of specific literary detectives (and I recognized all of them!) The beginning is a little slow but still packed with excellent jokes, but things really pick up once everyone is at the mansion.</p>
<p>The performances were all marvelous, but I was especially surprised by James Cromwell playing a wimpy French guy when I’m so used to him being a sly old man. And it’s kind of shocking that they put Peter Sellers under all that Chinese makeup in 1976, but then again they were intentionally poking fun at yellowface anyway.</p>
