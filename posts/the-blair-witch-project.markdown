Still holds up on a rewatch. Last time I saw this I was alone in a beach house at night, and it scared the poop out of me. This time it was with my wife in our living room, and it still caused me to feel a growing tightness in my chest and upset emotions all the way through, pretty much. The very end was actually the least scary part this time, because I remembered it coming, and also because I mixed up a detail with one from _Willow Creek_, which is the cameraperson getting pulled away into the woods while screaming.

I also apparently made up two other memories of this movie. One was, I thought that they wake up one morning to find hanging branch people in the trees (I combined two scenes). The second was, I thought there was a scene where the camera shows some silent footage of the woods at night, and the next morning they look at the footage and everyone admits that they didn't shoot it (then who did? OoOoOoOo).

The acting is very convincingly naturalistic. I think one of this movie's greatest strengths is that they really behave like young people on a documentary project in the woods, at first. You could complain that most of the movie is young people complaining in the woods, but I think that contributes to the sense of dread. It's mostly a survival movie actually. To be honest, there aren't even any supernatural occurrences. Every single creepy thing could be due to humans, but the movie doesn't really dwell on making the viewer try to figure out what is responsible. It's focused on the characters, and that's the most important part.

I really like that the lore of the Blair Witch is barely coherent. Sure, the story about the murdered kids is a consistent through-line, but there isn't even really a witch involved in that story. The only witch mentioned is by the crazy lady, and there's no obvious connection between that and the kid killings. And then there's the story that Heather tells in documentary segment about the men who had their bowels ripped out on Coffin Rock. It forces the movie to really be just about kids in the woods who get lost and then crazy stuff starts happening to them, but mostly they get screwed by human folly and ego and accidents.

I am fascinated by some of the more artistic decisions made in the editing process, thinking about them from the point-of-view of the in-universe "editor" of this found footage. Especially any of the parts where the audio you hear is from one camera capture, and the footage you see is from the other one. Like obviously that was put together by somebody other than the three who died in the woods, but why? I would love to pick the directors' brains about what led them to work some of that in to the movie, given that most of the rest is strictly naturalistic.

9/10
