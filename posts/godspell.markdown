I always thought I didn't like _Godspell_, because I had seen a high school play version of it and it struck me as kind of flimsy and corny, and just an excuse for teenagers to be involved in a musical that also has Christian trappings to make the parents approve of it more. After watching the movie, I definitely think that it's meant to be enjoyed by young people almost exclusively.

Who else could the target audience be? True hippies would probably be post-Christian enough to just think it's lame. The generation before the hippies would be offended that Jesus and his followers were being depicted as some peace-loving goofballs frolicking in the middle of an urban city. Faithful Christians would appreciate that it's sincere and dialogue-accurate, but I doubt anyone thinks it has the capacity to convert people, or even to give a new perspective to folks who already know the story.

But teenagers? They are in touch with their childish side enough where it's exciting to see all the followers doing voices and being silly. But they also see that Jesus is a powerful figure that draws people to him, and that "Judas" shows real conflict during his betrayal, so it lets some cast members show off their dramatic acting chops. And finally, what 16-year-old would not be immediately captivated by the music?

So once I began to settle in to the idea of the play (and the movie) being some kind of glorified school pageant, I began to appreciate the things that are good about _Godspell_, while also better understanding the things I don't like about it.

For example, the fact that the disciples tell some portions of the parables instead of them being mostly told by Jesus. It just seems like a really lame way to transition from scene to scene, and sometimes it's framed in exactly that way. It makes you wonder, are the disciples supposed to already know these stories because Christianity exists in their worldview already? Certainly some of the disciples spout Jesus' teachings back to him as if they're trying to please the teacher with how much they already know.

I also dislike any time Jesus is being goofy in the movie. It really makes it feel like everyone is in a sort of hippie cult, and that feels almost blasphemous because I don't think you need to make Christ into a laughing gnome of kindness to keep his message alive in today's world. I guess I prefer my Jesus depictions to be straight-serious the whole time.

The whole beginning of the movie, up until the end of the first song, is actually kind of ultimate-cringe for me. All these young folks just drop what they're doing when they see John the Baptist teleporting in front of them? The baptism scene is also too silly for words.

But I must admit, there are some ways that the movie made me pretty emotional. Especially the procession of Jesus' body after the crucifixion, when some of the songs get reprised in a medley, that made me almost tear up for some reason.

Overall, I think the show works better when there's more imagination involved (such as on a stage with props), but I can also admit that the movie is very competently put together. The choreography and set-pieces especially take the best advantage of the film medium, even if some times the literalness of a film depiction undercuts the quality of the scene overall (the crucifixion, the baptism, the Pharisee encounter).

7/10
